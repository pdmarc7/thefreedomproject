					<div><p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban visited Ukraine for the first time since the outbreak of the war on Tuesday, shortly after his country began its six-month rotation in the EU presidency. </p><p>Orban, who has worked against other EU and NATO members&#8217;s efforts to support Kyiv and punish Moscow, reportedly pitched the idea of an immediate ceasefire to his Ukrainian counterpart this week.</p><p>&#8220;The rules of international diplomacy are slow and complex. I asked the president to consider whether it would be possible to reverse the order and to speed up the peace negotiations with a swift ceasefire,&#8221; the Hungarian Prime Minister <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-viktor-orban-ukraine-volodymyr-zelenskyy-war-in-ukraine-peace-talks-ceasefire-negotiations-diplomacy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> after the meeting. </p><p>Meanwhile, Zelensky is warily watching world events and reading the signals and preparing for the possibility of a second Trump presidency, experts say.</p><p>&#8220;Zelenskyy can read the room. He saw the U.S. presidential debate and the outcome of the first round of the French and EU elections &#8212; and knows that if he wants to sustain support he has to work with the full cast of characters,&#8221; Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> Politico this week. </p><p>NATO, whose leaders will gather in Washington next week for its annual summit, has been working for months to &#8220;Trump-proof&#8221; the alliance&#8217;s support for Kyiv, but questions about how much money to commit and from whom remain. Foreign Policy magazine reported recently that Washington had provided <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/06/26/nato-trump-ukraine-assistance-biden-election/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nearly half</a> of the alliance&#8217;s 40 billion euros in aid each year over the last two years. </p><p>Politico also ran a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/07/02/nato-second-trump-term-00164517" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">detailed story</a> this week on how Trump&#8217;s potential advisers may approach transatlantic relations, which suggests big change if the former president returns to power in 2025. In addition to plans for a &#8220;radical reorientation&#8221; of the United States&#8217; role in the alliance, the piece reports that a future Trump White House could pledge to Moscow that NATO will not expand eastward. </p><p>&#8220;A swift resolution of the two-and-a-half-year Ukraine conflict would also likely play a key role in Trump&#8217;s plans for NATO,&#8221; according to Politico. &#8220;As part of a plan for Ukraine that has not been previously reported, the presumptive GOP nominee is mulling a deal whereby NATO commits to no further eastward expansion &#8212; specifically into Ukraine and Georgia &#8212; and negotiates with Russian President Vladimir Putin over how much Ukrainian territory Moscow can keep, according to two other Trump-aligned national security experts.&#8221;</p><p>Trump himself has stayed mostly <a href="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/presidential-debate-foreign-policy/" target="_self">noncommittal</a> about how exactly he plans on ending the war &#8212; only saying that Europe should carry more of the burden for helping Ukraine, that the war wouldn&#8217;t have happened under his watch and that, if elected again, he would have it resolved before assuming the presidency. </p><p>In other diplomatic news related to the war in Ukraine:</p><p>&#8212; Russia&#8217;s ambassador to the United Nations poured cold water on Trump&#8217;s assertions that the conflict could be solved quickly and easily. &#8220;The Ukrainian crisis cannot be solved in one day,&#8221; Vassily Nebenzia <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-russia-ukraine-war-un-election-a78ecb843af452b8dda1d52d137ca893" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told reporters</a> on Monday. During the same remarks, Nebenzia said that Zelensky&#8217;s ten-point peace formula that remains Ukraine&#8217;s official proposal is &#8220;not a peace plan but a joke.&#8221; </p><p>&#8212; Zelensky renews his calls for more long-range weapons and air defenses following a Russian missile attack in Vilniansk that killed seven and injured 31 others. &#8220;Our cities and communities suffer daily from such Russian strikes&#8221; Zelensky wrote in a post on Telegram, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7281yly9n4o" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a><strong>the BBC. </strong>&#8220;But he added that there were &#8216;ways to overcome this&#8217;, including &#8216;destroying Russian missile launchers, striking with real long-range capability and increasing the number of modern air defence systems.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p>&#8212; Putin met with Chinese President Xi Jinping during the annual Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting on Wednesday in Kazakhstan. The two nations were joined at the meeting by organization members Iran, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, as well as Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, who were present as observer states. </p><p>&#8220;Neither Ukraine nor any of its Western backers are attending, and major talks &#8212; or breakthroughs &#8212; on the war are not expected,&#8221; <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-china-iran-shanghai-cooperation-organization-sco-7d0dcd21ad34b09cc149e30567198b06" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a><strong>The Associated Press. &#8220;</strong>But because it&#8217;s rare these days for any meeting to include the heads of Russia, China, Turkey and the U.N., the possibility of talks about the war might be raised, at least on the peripheries of the summit, probably behind closed doors.&#8221;</p><p>&#8212; Three Ukrainian officials, including top Zelensky adviser Andriy Yermak, visited Washington this week to meet with members of the Biden administration, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken in advance of next week&#8217;s NATO summit. During this visit, Yermak said that Kyiv was open to taking advice on how to achieve a &#8220;just peace&#8221; with Moscow. But, he added &#8220;we [are] not ready to go to the compromise for the very important things and values ... independence, freedom, democracy, territorial integrity, sovereignty." </p><p><strong>U.S. State Department news:</strong><br></p><p><strong>&#8212; </strong>During a Tuesday press briefing, State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel rejected Orban&#8217;s suggestion that Kyiv and Moscow reach an immediate ceasefire. </p><p>&#8220;We and the NATO Alliance have been clear that there really is only one solution here, and that is the Russian Federation simply leaving Ukrainian territory,&#8221; Patel <a href="https://state.gov/briefings/department-press-briefing-july-2-2024/#post-569788-UKRAINERUSSIAREGION" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>. &#8220;We have long felt that this is, again, just another example of Russia being the aggressor, infringing on Ukrainian territorial integrity and sovereignty, throwing the UN Charter by the wayside.&#8221;</p><p>It&#8217;s not difficult to see why it was considered safer to keep Kallas out of NATO: while there is a consensus in the EU that Russia is the bloc&#8217;s main security threat, Kallas went much further than most leaders in her combative rhetoric. She <a href="https://x.com/eeldenden/status/1792880764498935872?s=46" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> Russia&#8217;s dismemberment into many smaller nation states would not be &#8220;a bad thing.&#8221; She enthusiastically <a href="https://x.com/leonidragozin/status/1806144325429940570" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">endorsed</a> NAFO (so-called North Atlantic Fellas Association) that is infamous for organizing xenophobic online harassment campaigns against anyone &#8212; including former and possibly future high-ranking <a href="https://x.com/ElbridgeColby/status/1789384282919616815" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">American defense officials</a> &#8212; perceived as &#8220;soft on Russia.&#8221;</p><p>There is also more than a whiff of hypocrisy about Kallas: while she called for Russia&#8217;s isolation, her husband <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/kaja-kallas-husband-russian-business-ties-estonia/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">continued profiting</a> from his business ties with Russia well after the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. This, alongside some political missteps, has made her an unpopular figure in her native Estonia and led to <a href="https://news.err.ee/1609076498/postimees-and-epl-kaja-kallas-resign" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">calls for her resignation</a>, which she ignored.</p><p>The fact that Berlin and other major capitals saw it less risky for someone like Kallas to be appointed as the &#8220;EU Head of Earnest Communiques,&#8221; in the <a href="https://x.com/blagden_david/status/1806094681249313126" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">words</a> of British analyst David Blagden, rather than an actual military alliance like NATO, preferring the seasoned Dutch Prime Minister Marc Rutte for the latter job instead, speaks volumes about the regard held for the position of the high representative.</p><p>That is because despite its lofty title, the post has no real power. The high representative is not the foreign minister of the EU. He or she is a vice president of the European Commission, the bloc&#8217;s executive arm, thus technically a subordinate to its president. The European External Action Service (EEAS), with its more than 5,000 officials both in Brussels and EU delegations abroad, is at his or her disposal, but all the budgetary levers are in the hands of the Commission. Thus, the high representative and his or her team are forced to spend an inordinate amount of time in turf battles with other branches of the Brussels machinery to get anything done.</p><p>Most importantly, despite all the proclamations of a &#8220;geopolitical Europe,&#8221; the EU has no competences over the member states&#8217; foreign and defense policies. It is the Council of the EU, i.e. the member states, who set the bloc&#8217;s foreign policy, and every single one of them holds a veto power, thus capable, in principle, to block common policies.</p><p>This is unlikely to change as national security is traditionally the most zealously guarded prerogative of a nation-state, and more so with the rise of sovereigntist political forces in Europe as attested by the results of the last elections to the European Parliament. In a way, the high representative&#8217;s job is impossible.</p><p>These structural limitations can be offset, to an extent, by the personality of the office holder. The most impactful EU top diplomat was Javier Solana who held the position from 1999 to 2009 &#8212; ironically before the Lisbon Treaty created the EEAS meant, in theory, to bolster the job. But Solana assumed the office after leading NATO which gave him extra clout, respect from the member states, and international visibility, all of which his successors lacked. Still, his successor, Federica Mogherini, can be credited with getting the Iran nuclear deal over the line, and Borrell with efforts to get that same deal revived after President Trump&#8217;s withdrawal in 2018 and taking a principled stance on Gaza.</p><p>Expectations are significantly lower with Kallas. Kristi Raik from the Tallinn-based International Centre for Defence and Security, while offering a sympathetic view of her candidacy, <a href="https://x.com/KristiRaik/status/1806235836893036905" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">points</a> to the challenge of being &#8220;a strong leader, while not being too radical for the taste of some member states, which could be counter-productive.&#8221; Yet Kallas&#8217; consensus-building skills are yet to be tested.</p><p>Kallas has yet to offer much evidence of her interest in or understanding of how much of the world works beyond her part of Europe. Yet she will have to deal with the crises in the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, manage relations with China and Asia-Pacific. As the high representative, she will chair the joint commission on the implementation of the nuclear agreement with Iran, which her predecessors Mogherini and Borrell were strongly committed to. Her views on the subject are entirely unknown, as they are on the Israel/Palestine question. As a Brussels-based analyst Shada Islam <a href="https://x.com/shada_islam/status/1806332844894978448" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a>, &#8220;the EU&#8217;s standing is already low over double standards in Gaza. Eager to know how Kallas intends to learn about a complex world beyond Europe.&#8221;</p><p>An advent of a new Trump administration in Washington could pose additional challenges as some of its <a href="https://x.com/ElbridgeColby/status/1806353575511036359" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">prospective officials</a> appear to be decidedly less interested in countering Russia than China. Navigating this relationship will require diplomatic skill more than moralistic exhortations about the need for a continued U.S. involvement in the European security.</p><p>In the end, however, none of that may matter too much. A high representative perceived as weak, a loose cannon, or both, will simply ensure that the EU external partners will gravitate even more explicitly towards the member states and the Commission, with the high representative and the EEAS mostly reduced to issuing statements of concern.</p></div>
