                <ul>
                    <li>
                                        Surprisingly, there are many Maldives-like sandbars in the US that look and feel like a tropical island atoll.
                        </li>
                    <li>
                                        Torch Lake near Rapid City in Michigan is one of the most stunning US sandbars with white sand and turquoise waters, earning it the nickname the "Maldives of Michigan".
                        </li>
                    <li>
                                        Florida Peanut Island Sandbar in West Palm Beach and Three Rooker Island in Clearwater are among the most beautiful sandbars in the USA that give off tropical Maldives vibes.
                        </li>
            </ul>

    
        
    
 
<p>                    Sandbars are naturally formed by the forces of waves or water currents that carry sand or sediments onto the beach over time&#8212;submerged but partially exposed. These formed ridges of sand are more exposed when it's low tide and become popular lounging points for tourists, especially on sunny days.
    </p>

    
<p>                    The world is dotted with otherworldly landscapes, and beaches are no exception&#8212;with sandbars as the crowning features. Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and the Maldives are among the world's top destinations for beaches and sandbars.
    </p>

    
<p>                    A visit to Sumilon Island, one of the <a href="https://www.thetravel.com/things-to-do-in-oslob-cebu-philippines/">best things to do in Oslob, Cebu</a> in the Philippines, gives travelers a chance to experience its pristine, white-sand beaches and gorgeous sandbar. And, of course, <a href="https://www.thetravel.com/best-islands-in-the-maldives-to-visit-in-summer/">the Maldives, famous for its amazing islands, beaches, and sandbars, is perfect for a magical summer escape</a>.
    </p>

    
<p>                    Still, as these gorgeous destinations take center stage, the US is also not to be messed with when it comes to beaches and sandbars. Americans don't have to venture into foreign lands to experience Maldives-like sandbars, either. Florida and Hawaii, for instance, are a match, as are certain other (and rather surprising) destinations across the country, like Michigan. Picture the crystal-clear blue waters, white-sand beaches, and stunning sandbars&#8212;yes, the USA has many of these, just like tropical paradises do!
    </p>

    
<p>                    Even <a href="https://www.thetravel.com/most-beautiful-coastal-towns-in-the-us/">America's most beautiful coastal towns</a> are among the top places to visit if you're looking for gorgeous sandbars that look and feel like a tropical Maldives oasis, especially now that summer is already in full swing. Here are some of the most stunning places with the best sandbars in America (crystal-clear turquoise waters included)&#8212;and cocktails too!

<p>                    Gleaming with clean and clear waters, rich marine life, a beautiful beach, and a sandbar, Peanut Island Sandbar breathes new life into its humble beginnings as a stack of sand in the early 20th century. Today, the island is one of the top tourist destinations in Florida for beachgoers and adventurers. Its location on the Intracoastal Waterway between West Palm Beach and Riviera Beach makes it more inviting for locals and tourists to explore its pristine sandy beaches.
    </p>

    
<p>                    The sandbar in the north of the island is where the spotlight is&#8212;dotted with boats and beachgoers who want to go snorkeling, boating, or simply enjoy basking in the sun (with a delicious drink in hand)! The vistas are also not to be missed, with the <a href="https://www.thetravel.com/why-blue-heron-bridge-is-special/">Blue Heron Bridge, home to some of the best scuba diving in Florida</a>, Port of Palm Beach, and stunning marinas in view.
    </p>

    
<p>                    Look out for sea turtles, manatees, colorful tropical fish, and many more. Visitors might even see them on the 10-minute boat ride there!
    </p>

     



    

        
            
<p>                    There are tour operators that offer boat trips to Peanut Island, including <a href="https://sandhillcharters.com/sandbar-boat-tours/#:~:text=3%20Hours%20For%20%24550.00&amp;text=Peanut%20Island%20is%20where%20boaters,middle%20of%20the%20Intracoastal%20Waterway." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sandhill Charters</a> and <a href="https://cruisintikiswpb.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cruisin Tikis</a>. The <a href="https://peanutislandshuttleboat.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Peanut Island Shuttle Boat</a> leaves the mainland every 25 minutes and suggests advance booking for tickets, although walk-ins are welcome on a first-come, first-served basis.

<p>                    Three Rooker Island is also one of the <a href="https://www.thetravel.com/places-in-florida-that-feel-like-the-caribbean/">best places in Florida that feel like the Caribbean</a>&#8212;and for good reason! The sandbar, which was formed due to erosion, has just emerged in the last decade and has been one of the top tourist destinations in the Sunshine State, giving off tropical Maldives vibes.
    </p>

    
<p>                    Three Rooker Island is semicircular, but it changes from time to time due to the behavior of the water currents. It features white-sugary-sand beaches, crystal-clear blue waters, and a dramatic flora and fauna, which is why it was designated as a wildlife sanctuary.
    </p>

    
<p>                    Three Rooker Island is only accessible by boat as it's separated from the mainland, but there are tour operators who take travelers to the island, where people can enjoy snorkeling, fishing, bird-watching, and swimming.
