<p>Kagi Maldives Resort and Spa is a heavenly sanctuary of serenity and wellness &#8211; a unique and indulgent retreat for those seeking relaxation, rejuvenation, and a deeper connection with nature. LLM&#8217;s Maldives expert Lisa Curtiss checks in to find out more.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hotel</h2>
 


 



<p>Even if this is not your first Maldives stay, you will be instantly captivated by how charmingly pretty this small island is. Tropical vegetation, accented with colourful hibiscus and richly scented frangipani trees fringe the sandy pathways while, on the beaches, the sand is particularly white and fine and the crystal-clear sea a spectrum of the brightest blues. It&#8217;s blissfully peaceful too, with an unpretentious, welcoming yet calm vibe.</p>



<p>As the resort&#8217;s name implies, the heart of Kagi Maldives Resort and Spa lies in its wellness offerings and it features an over-water, distinctively designed state-of-the-art spa that is dedicated to promoting physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. Here, inspiration is drawn from ancient wisdom and time-honoured healing traditions, with a wide choice of treatments and therapies to indulge in.</p>



<p>Kagi Maldives Resort and Spa is dedicated to minimising its environmental impact and has implemented a raft of eco-friendly practices such as energy conservation, waste management, and the use of sustainable materials. These initiatives contribute to the preservation of the natural beauty on and around the island, allowing guests to enjoy a sustainable and responsible luxury experience and to preserve its beauty for future guests.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Room</h2>
 


 



<p>Kagi Maldives Resort and Spa offers a collection of 50 villas including 19 lagoon pool villas, 21 ocean pool villas and 10 beach pool villas. All are styled with a distinct, tasteful, and contemporary design, complemented by the original Maldivian element of luxury. Additionally, each features a secluded deck that offers pure privacy to luxuriate in al fresco rain showers, moonlit dips, or intimate afternoons basking in the sun. Inside, you&#8217;ll discover an over-sized king bed, veneer floors, air conditioning, overhead fan, and a seating area, plus a huge array of amenities for your comfort and enjoyment.</p>



<p>A key highlight for many guests, including us, is having your own generously sized and private infinity pool. Little beats that true Maldives experience of gazing out from the cooling waters of your pool, watching colourful shoals of fish below, and if you&#8217;re lucky, pods of playful dolphin glide by.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Food and drink</h2>
 


 



<p>The talented chefs across the resort&#8217;s restaurants go above and beyond to create dishes that are not only delicious, but in keeping with the ethos of the resort, also nourishing, and designed to promote a sense of well-being. From vibrant salads to succulent seafood and flavourful vegetarian options, every meal is a multi-sensory experience. The restaurants also happily cater to individual dietary preferences and offer personalised menus, ensuring that each guest&#8217;s culinary experience is in keeping with their tastes and needs.</p>



<p>Noo Faru, with its views over the pool and the Indian Ocean, is the perfect setting for the extensive breakfast and dinner buffet, where guests can experience a variety of international cuisines, skilfully prepared using the finest ingredients and fresh herbs. Poolside, Ufaa provides everything needed to enjoy a splendid, sunny Maldivian day without venturing far from your lounger: here, you can savour a collection of tasty bites and refreshing drinks to keep you sated and hydrated throughout the day.</p>



<p>As part of your wellness journey at the Baani Spa, with its turquoise ocean setting, you can choose from a range of raw food, greens, light mains, and sushi at Spa Corner. Its casual daytime menu and soothing ambience provide the perfect complement to spa treatments and wellness-focused relaxation. Meanwhile, at Ke-Un, diners can feast their eyes on glorious ocean views, while tantalising their tastebuds on Pacific Ring of Fire fusion cuisine, blending flavours from Hawaii to Thailand and from Japan to Peru, all with an emphasis on creative innovation and fresh seasonality.</p>



 



<p>You may be in a tropical island paradise, but that&#8217;s not to say that you won&#8217;t have the occasional craving for European food. If this strikes, make your way to the first level of Noo Faru, where you&#8217;ll find Nonna. Here, against a backdrop of the Indian Ocean, you can indulge in deliciously crafted Italian food paired with wine from the resort&#8217;s very own state-of-the-art wine cellar. This cellar features a vast selection of eminent labels with strong representation from both Old and New World producers, as well as many world-renowned vintages, all providing a formidable selection of wines to accompany every dining experience and please every palate.</p>



<p>Naturally, you can also enjoy wonderful, leisurely dining in the comfort of your own luxurious villa 24 hours a day &#8211; either indoor, or on your private deck alongside your pool, with that unbeatable view over the ocean or lagoon.</p>



<p>With staff teams who are warm, attentive, and genuinely committed to providing you with an exceptional stay, service at Kagi Maldives Resort and Spa is impeccable. From the moment of arrival, you are greeted with broad smiles and a level of personalised attention that far exceeds expectations.</p>



<p>If you wish to enhance your stay further, the premium all-inclusive package offered by Kagi is certainly worth your consideration, elevating your stay with an assortment of special benefits such as a sunset dolphin cruise, a selection of premium alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, dine around options and more.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Spa</h2>
 


 



<p>Kagi&#8217;s Baani Spa goes above and beyond the usual Maldives spa offerings of massages, facials, scrubs, pedicures and the like, and instead aims to deliver the very foundations of wellness and health through a dynamic process of self-care and recalibration. The philosophy of Baani Spa is to embrace the fundamentals of nature, sound, nutrition, bodywork, beauty, mindfulness, and movement, and to lean into a holistic healing journey to release stress, restore balance and regain momentum and flow.</p>



<p>During your stay, make time to experience a sound bath, to practise yoga and to indulge in as many treatments as can be comfortably scheduled in with the excellent therapists, who operate in treatment rooms and relaxation areas, which all have wonderful ocean views.</p>



<p>Both the yoga sound room and fitness centre are air conditioned; the latter is equipped with a range of internationally known Precor equipment, along with a healthy culinary section offering fresh juices and a unique raw cuisine concept. You can also enjoy delicious and nourishing meals at the Baani Spa &#8211; all in a peaceful, over water setting with a gentle breeze and the sound of the sea.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">To do</h2>
 


 



<p>Many activities and amenities, designed to elevate the guest experience, are offered at Kagi Maldives Resort and Spa. The resort&#8217;s location provides easy access to vivid coral reefs, making it an ideal destination for snorkelling and diving enthusiasts. The waters offer high visibility and are teeming with marine life inhabiting a captivating underwater world that&#8217;s magical to witness from behind your mask. For those who prefer to soak up the sun, the resort&#8217;s infinity pool and pristine beaches provide the perfect setting for lounging.</p>



<p>Although many come to the Maldives to explore its underwater realms, Kagi is an exceptionally good place to dive, with their Euro-Divers team dedicated to ensuring you have the best experience during your stay, whether you are a beginner or advanced diver. As well as having an intimate knowledge of the reef, which allows them to guide you to the liveliest sections, they also offer specialist courses like nitrox and fluo night diving for already-certified divers.</p>



 



<p>If you prefer to be on, rather than under the sea, a catamaran trip will allow you to feel the breeze on your face, and, with any luck, spot some dolphins frolicking in the turquoise waters. Alternatively, you can use one of the resort&#8217;s kayaks or see-through stand-up paddle boards and explore the surrounding waters of the island from another perspective &#8211; while windsurfing, although requiring a little more skill, is a fun way to take to the water as well.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">In a nutshell</h2>
 


 



<p>Kagi Maldives Resort and Spa is a true hidden gem that offers its guests a seamless combination of wellness, luxury, and natural beauty. From the serene surroundings and the exceptional spa to the broad selection of culinary offerings, attentive service, and host of wellness offerings, every aspect of the resort is designed to create a transformative and unforgettable retreat.</p>



<p>Whether your aim is to switch off, to embark on a wellness journey, or to simply reconnecting with nature, Kagi Maldives Resort and Spa allows you to nourish your mind, body, and soul.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Factbox</h3>
 


<p><strong>Getting there:</strong> To reach Kagi Maldives Resort and Spa, which is located at the northern tip of the North Male Atoll, you have the option of a pleasant hour-long boat ride, or a 15-minute seaplane hop from Velana International Airport (54km). The beauty of this choice is that you&#8217;re less likely to encounter long transfer waits and delays &#8211; which means that you can reach your dreamy destination swiftly.</p>
