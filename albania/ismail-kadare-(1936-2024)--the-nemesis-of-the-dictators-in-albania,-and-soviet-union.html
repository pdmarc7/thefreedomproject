					<div>    <p>Kadare spent 30 years of an active life  under dictator Enver Hoxha, who ruled Albania from 1946  until his death in 1985 &#8212; writing in the dark times of the dark times, when his  own destiny depended on the dictates of the regime. Often compared to the two  other staunch critics of totalitarianism, George Orwell and Franz Kafka, Kadare  cloaked his subversive writing in allegory, myth, fable, and other devices. The  stratagem to imbue his books with subtle critiques of power helped him evade  the authorities&#8217; scrutiny in the isolated Balkan nation, which relied on the  Soviet Union between 1948 and 1960.</p>        <p>In his writing &#8212; novels, poetry and  essays &#8212; Kadare explores the long battles between the writer and the  dictator, between freedom and oppression. His swan song, <i>A Dictator Calls </i>(Counterpoint),  a novel translated by John Hodgson and longlisted for the 2024  International Booker Prize, is centred on a similar theme: writers living in  the shadow of tyranny. A multi-layered exploration of  power, art, and memory, it foregrounds an inscrutable, fabled  three-minute phone call between Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin and Nobel  Prize-winning poet and novelist Boris Pasternak on June 23,  1934. </p>    <p>The conversation revolved around the arrest of  fellow poet Osip Mandelstam, whose poem criticizing Stalin  led to his arrest and eventual death. About a year ago, he had composed and  recited a doggerel, now known as &#8216;The Stalin Epigram,&#8217; in which he had termed  Stalin as &#8216;the Kremlin mountaineer&#8217; with &#8216;ten thick worms his fingers,&#8217; and  &#8216;the huge laughing cockroaches on his top lip,&#8217; who dug a pit for the poet. In  the concluding four lines, Mandelstam writes:  &#8216;<i>He  forges decrees in a line like horseshoes/One for the groin, one the forehead,  temple, eye/ He rolls the executions on his tongue like berries./ He wishes he  could hug them like big friends from home.&#8217;</i><br></p>        <p><b>&#8216;Art,  unlike a tyrant, receives no mercy, but only gives it&#8217;</b><br></p>    <p>When Stalin had called Pasternak, he  had asked him about Mandelstam, and according to the KGB archives, Pasternak  had denied knowing his friend, adding, &#8220;So I can&#8217;t say anything about  Mandelstam.&#8221; Stalin had replied, &#8220;Whereas I can say you&#8217;re a very poor comrade,  Comrade Pasternak,&#8221; and then hung up. Most accounts (a majority of them from  women) of the call agree on these key points: the fact that Stalin had called,  and that Pasternak had refused to share anything about his friend; and Stalin  had been sharp in his retort, and subsequently disconnected. The  exchange becomes the focal point of Kadare&#8217;s exploration into the complex  relationship between writers and tyranny.  He weaves together historical  facts, personal dreams, and memories to reconstruct this encounter.<br></p>    <p>Told in the first-person voice of the  writer-narrator, the novel draws from a wide range of sources, including  witness accounts, press reports, KGB records, and the perspectives of  contemporary writers, and provides a multi-layered and nuanced perspective on  the event.  Seemingly innocuous, the interaction&#8217;s implications go far beyond this single slice of history. Kadare  examines 13 different versions of the conversation to drive home the elusive  nature of truth under whimsical dictators hell-bent on controlling the  narrative by telling their own stories, and the power dynamics between  dictators and artists: &#8220;The conversation was beyond improbable, beyond impossible, an evil omen  come from another world. The poet and the tyrant should never have been put  together. But an authoritative voice ensured that it happened. Whether they  wished it or not, they were together, two manifest&#173;ations of the same thing:  power. Slaves of each other in the same circle of Dante. Torturing each other,  each the other&#8217;s downfall, whether for three minutes or for as many centuries  or millennia was of no importance.&#8221;<br></p>        <p><b>&#8216;The alter ego, and the nemesis of the  dictator&#8217;</b><br></p>    <p>To  Kadare, the novel became a way to exorcise one of his &#8216;overworked obsessions&#8217;:  Pasternak&#8217;s three minutes &#8212; buried beneath the layers of official narratives,  obfuscated by history. &#8220;Whether by accident or not, this phone call was so close  to me, and I was compelled to analyse each moment of those fatal 200  seconds, when the laws of tragedy had brought the poet and the tyrant together.  It was a grim collision, which should not have taken place, and yet it did, to  our fellow artist&#8217;s misfortune. And so, we who know something about this matter  are obliged to bear witness to it, even those aspects that are impossible to  confirm. Moment by moment, second by second ... Just as he and all our  brothers-in-art bore witness to it, without anybody knowing and without taking  anyone&#8217;s side. Because art, unlike a tyrant, receives no mercy, but only gives  it,&#8221; writes Kadare for whom this act of bearing witness was not merely an  intellectual exercise, but a moral imperative.<br></p>        <p>Those familiar with Kadare&#8217;s outstanding oeuvre will notice <i>A  Dictator Calls&#8217;</i> connection with his earlier novel, <i>Twilight of the  Eastern Gods </i>(2014)<i>. </i>The latter, based on his experiences in  Moscow during his years as a student at Gorky Institute between 1958 and  1960, offers a glimpse into the oppressive atmosphere of the Soviet Union  and the challenges faced by artists under Stalin&#8217;s rule. <i>A Dictator Calls</i>  revisits this period, diving deeper into the personal and political  ramifications of Pasternak&#8217;s Nobel Prize win and the subsequent persecution he  had to endure. Like his previous novels &#8212; <i>The  City without Signs</i> (1959), <i>The Shadow</i> (1986) and <i>The  Pyramid</i> (1992) &#8212; it boasts of a single-minded defiance of dictatorship. The  truth of Kadare&#8217;s existence as a writer lies in the contradictions, as Peter  Morgan writes in <i>Ismail Kadare: The Writer and the Dictatorship,  1957&#8211;1990: </i>&#8220;He is the voice of Albania&#8217;s modernity and the singer of its  ancient identity. He is the alter ego and the nemesis of the dictator. In this  ambiguity lies the key to his life, his reputation, and his works.&#8221;<br></p>     <p><b>The  cursed Nobel that he never got, and Pasternak couldn&#8217;t have  </b></p>    <p>Early  in <i>A Dictator Calls</i>, Kadare, a frontrunner for the Nobel Prize in  Literature for many years, imagines his connections with Pasternak, whose  novel, <i>Doctor Zhivago &#8212; </i>the story of Yuri Zhivago, a doctor and poet, during the tumultuous years of the Russian  Revolution and its aftermath, it had captured the hearts and minds of readers  around the world &#8212; had helped him win the Nobel Prize, but the announcement was  met with hostility due to its perceived criticism of the Soviet system, and he  was forced to decline the honour. Kadare writes, with a touch of poetic  flourish, that Pasternak  &#8216;died from the Nobel Prize.&#8217; He imagines how he himself was tongue-tied when Hoxha called him to congratulate for one of his poems. </p>    <p>The Nobel prize also oddly united him  with Pasternak. &#8220;Should I say that the Nobel Prize had never crossed  my mind? Of course not. I&#8217;d thought of it often, but especially years later  when it was whispered that I myself . . . might be on that list. So to me  this uproar against Pasternak included a strange and entirely different  element. As if it were not only about him but about someone else, perhaps even  myself. This produced in me a severe but intoxicating anxiety. Imagine standing  alone in front of your country, which insults you and yells in your face with  hatred and love at the same time. Give back that cursed prize, scream the  students, pregnant women, the miners of Tepelen&#235;. But you, a capricious  waverer, like Hamlet in his dilemma, can&#8217;t decide whether to take it or not to  take it,&#8221; he writes.</p>     <p>Kadare shot to global acclaim after the publication of his debut novel,<i>  The General of the Dead Army</i> (1963), a visceral and unflinching portrait of  the aftermath of war that revolves around a General &#8212; burdened by the weight of  history and futility of war &#8212; tasked with exhuming the remains of his fallen  soldiers in the ravaged Albanian countryside.  His other novels &#8212;<i>The  File on H</i>, <i>The Palace of Dreams, The Pyramid, The Accident</i>, and <i>A  Girl in Exile </i>&#8212; all dissect the mechanism of power. In <i>The Palace of  Dreams</i> (1981), an oppressive bureaucratic entity in a dystopian empire  collects and analyses the dreams of its citizens, identifying and reporting  those deemed dangerous to the Sultan.</p>    <p>Writing about Mandelstam  and Pasternak, he writes that though the circumstances of their death &#8212;  Pasternak died of lung cancer in his dacha in Peredelkino, and Mandelstam in an  exile&#8217;s shack (a transit camp near Vladivostok after his arrest) &#8212; were  different, they were similar after all.  &#8220;In this world, poets are always  similar, whether in the bright light of fame or in the darkness of grief.  Mandelstam and Pasternak were similar without knowing it, or wishing it.&#8221; We  can perhaps say the same of Pasternak and Kadare, who lived to tell the tale. </p></div>
