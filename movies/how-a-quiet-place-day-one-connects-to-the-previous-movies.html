I feel that way when I watch it. But it's a tricky one, it's definitely risky," he added.</p><p>The prequel made a big noise at the <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a60378839/highest-grossing-movies-box-office/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">box office</a> with a <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a61463639/a-quiet-place-day-one-record-debut/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">record-breaking opening weekend</a>, despite not having any major connections to the previous two movies, and has grossed over $221 million so far at the global box office.</p><p>As we wait for <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a36553200/a-quiet-place-3-release-date/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">A Quiet Place 3</a>, the movie moves the action to New York City and follows Samira (<a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a61206659/lupita-nyongo-quiet-place-day-one-cat/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">Lupita Nyong'o</a>) and Eric (<a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a61247551/joseph-quinn-a-quiet-place-day-one/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">Joseph Quinn</a>), along with <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a61420194/a-quiet-place-day-one-cat/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">Samira's cat Frodo</a>, as they try to survive and get out of the city before it's too late.</p><p>Even though the Abbott family are not involved, you might still expect some connection to what's come before, especially in terms of where these new characters are at the time of the first two movies.</p><p>So let's delve into the events of <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a61107786/quiet-place-day-one-runtime-how-long/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">A Quiet Place: Day One</a> and its ending to explain how it connects to the previous two movies, especially the sequel <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a36515266/a-quiet-place-2-review/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">A Quiet Place Part II</a>.</p><p>Major <strong>spoilers</strong> ahead.</p><h2>When is A Quiet Place: Day One set?</h2><p>In case the title didn't give it away, A Quiet Place: Day One starts on the very first day of the alien invasion, with events taking place over roughly the next four days.</p><p>It means that the movie takes place more than a year before the majority of the events of <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a853244/a-quiet-place-review-emily-blunt-john-krasinski/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">A Quiet Place</a> and A Quiet Place Part II.</p><p>There is one exception as the sequel opened with day one of the invasion, before jumping ahead to day 474 immediately after the events of the first movie. However, that Part II opening was set in Millbrook, New York and not New York City, so don't expect any crossovers.</p><p>We do see one Part II character in A Quiet Place: Day One though: <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a43300496/lupita-nyongo-quiet-place-prequel-movie-djimon-hounsou/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">Djimon Hounsou's Man on Island</a>, who we now know is called Henri. He's in New York City with his family when the invasion starts and crosses paths with Samira, before playing a major role later.</p><p>So let's delve into that major Part II connection in A Quiet Place: Day One's ending. Final warning for major <strong>spoilers</strong> ahead.</p><h2>A Quiet Place: Day One ending explained &#8211; how it connects to Part II</h2><p>It's revealed in the opening scene that Samira is <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a61483697/a-quiet-place-day-one-samira-cancer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">living with terminal cancer</a> and once the invasion starts, she has one goal in mind: head back to the pizza place she went to with her father for one final slice of pizza.</p><p>After meeting Eric, she tries initially to get him to go away and head to the harbour to get on the boats that are evacuating people from New York City. He refuses to leave though, so he tags along on the journey to get some pizza.</p><p>She's grateful for that in the end as after her medication is destroyed during one of the alien attacks, Eric heads out on a dangerous mission to get her some pain-relief medication while she rests up in a church with other survivors.</p><p>Eric returns with her medication and the next day, they head out to find Patsy's Pizzeria. Unfortunately, when they get there, it's been destroyed in the attacks and any pizza is long gone.</p><p>They go to the nearby jazz club that Samira used to go to with her father and, in a beautiful sequence, Eric gets some random pizza from a nearby restaurant that's still in one piece, scribbles 'Patsy's' on the box, and they enjoy a slice of pizza from 'Patsy's Pizzeria'.</p><p>From the jazz club, Samira spots that boats are just about to leave from the harbour and they head out to get on them. When they're cornered by aliens though, Samira creates a distraction so that Eric &#8211; and, more importantly, <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a61467645/a-quiet-place-day-one-frodo/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">Frodo</a> &#8211; can get to the boats.</p><p>Luckily for them, Henri is on one of the boats that's about to leave and, spotting the commotion on the dock, he stops the boat in time for Eric to be able to swim to it with Frodo.</p><p>Samira then heads to the burnt-out Patsy's Pizzeria. After one final look at a photo of her with her father (who is wearing the same yellow cardigan that she wears in the movie, which she gives to Eric before leaving him), she heads into the street.</p><p>As she listens to 'Feeling Good', Samira purposefully takes out the headphones of her iPod and an alien lands behind her as Day One comes to an end.</p><p>Nyong'o told <a href="https://people.com/lupita-nyongo-quiet-place-cancer-storyline-therapeutic-after-chadwick-boseman-exclusive-8669687" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">People</a> that she loved how Samira was "given agency up until the end, that she went out on her own terms".</p><p>"I think that it was a very risky story that [writer-director] Michael Sarnoski chose to tell," she added. "And it just shows again, even when life is slipping there is still more life to live, until there's not."</p><p>"Sam takes back her agency and her joy, and I think trying to feel that way while you&#8217;re seeing [her choose to die on her own terms] was kind of the fun challenge of it" Sarnoski himself explained in an interview with <a href="https://discussingfilm.net/2024/07/05/director-michael-sarnoski-explains-the-emotional-ending-of-a-quiet-place-day-one-exclusive/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">Discussing Film</a>.</p><p>"I was excited by what many people would think is a risky ending, and hopefully, we pulled it off. I&#8217;m happy with it. I feel that way when I watch it. But it's a tricky one, it's definitely risky," he added.</p><p>Before that happens though, we see Eric safely on the boat with Frodo. He finds a letter in the pocket of the cardigan that Samira wrote to him, thanking him for "bringing me home" and asking him to take care of Frodo.</p><p>This is where the Part II connection comes in because, as luck would have it, Eric and Frodo end up on Henri's boat. We know from the sequel that Henri made it to an island where he set up a sanctuary for survivors.</p><p>Henri's boat was one of only two to make it, so Eric chose wisely. While, of course, we don't see Eric (or Frodo) in Part II as Day One didn't exist then, we can assume that he also made it to the island in one piece.</p><p>It's certainly what writer/director Michael Sarnoski thinks too.</p><p>"Definitely a good portion of those people probably ended up on the island," he told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/quiet-place-day-one-director-cat-frodo-interview-1235933991/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">The Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p><p>"I think there's a good chance that they're there, and definitely there's a good chance we're going to see them again."</p><p>Whether he survived the alien attack that took place on the island at <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a36557127/a-quiet-place-2-ending-explained/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">the end of Part II</a> is another question. But since that was day 477, Eric did at least enjoy more than a year of peace before having to fight for his life again.</p><p>And after everything he's been through, we think he deserves it.</p><h4>For more on A Quiet Place: Day One, check out:</h4><p>&#8226; <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a61417304/a-quiet-place-day-one-review/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">A Quiet Place: Day One review</a><br>&#8226; <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a61107786/quiet-place-day-one-runtime-how-long/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">How long is A Quiet Place: Day One?</a><br>&#8226; <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a61420194/a-quiet-place-day-one-cat/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">Does the cat die in A Quiet Place: Day One?</a><br>&#8226; <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a36553200/a-quiet-place-3-release-date/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">Everything you need to know about A Quiet Place 3<br></a><strong>&#8226; </strong><a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a61496298/watch-a-quiet-place-day-one-streaming/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">How to watch A Quiet Place: Day One</a></p><p><strong>A Quiet Place: Day One is out now in cinemas.</strong></p><p><strong>You Might Also Like</strong></p></div>
