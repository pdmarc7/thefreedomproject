                                        <p>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) &#8212; A plan to stage a coup against Bolivia&#8217;s president was not what Gen. Tom&#225;s Pe&#241;a y Lillo was expecting when he entered the military headquarters in La Paz last Wednesday.</p><p>The leader of Bolivia&#8217;s retired service members said he was surprised to get a call that morning from <a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" href="https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-army-chief-coup-attempted-foiled-2698e4bf34f25f8dddb1542a41f2f27d">army chief Gen. Juan Jos&#233; Z&#250;&#241;iga</a> with a request to report for talks about how to advocate for imprisoned soldiers.</p><p>It was a coveted meeting, so he rushed over to find Z&#250;&#241;iga surrounded by officers asking for their help in &#8220;defending democracy.&#8221; Pe&#241;a y Lillo claims he demurred, but tanks were already rumbling out of the barracks toward the presidential palace.</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a tragicomedy,&#8221; Pe&#241;a y Lillo, now a fugitive wanted for his participation in the <a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" href="https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-military-deployment-arce-coup-fears-028cd88f3be1fb02164c05deb0faa099">alleged coup attempt</a>, told The Associated Press by phone from an undisclosed location. </p><p>Like many Bolivians, he said he struggled to piece the story together, recalling how &#8220;there had been a lot of talk in the military that (Bolivian President Luis) Arce would hand the government over to Z&#250;&#241;iga&#8221; as protests <a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" href="https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-economy-distrust-arce-morales-cdb4672eb26c68d130df924fa2913403">roiled the country over shortages</a> of dollars and fuel.</p>
     

<p>The retired general&#8217;s comments mark another surreal turn in the nation&#8217;s efforts to establish the facts of what happened on June 26, when military forces <a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" href="https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-coup-arce-morales-military-army-la-paz-b41453606ccd31c8f0cc4b3b7e3732ca">stormed downtown La Paz</a>, stunning the country and spinning off waves of rumors from the mundane to the absurd.</p>

 

<p>A week after the purported rebellion roiled the South American country that has seen no fewer than 190 coups since its independence in 1825, Bolivians who thought they&#8217;d seen it all say they&#8217;ve never been more confused.</p>
     
<p>&#8220;This is so strange, so unbelievable,&#8221; said Marcia Ti&#241;ini, a 58-year-old teacher in La Paz. &#8220;First I believed the government and felt solidarity, but now I don&#8217;t know what to say.&#8221; </p><p>When Z&#250;&#241;iga and his swarm of armored vehicles disappeared from the capital&#8217;s main plaza after the three-hour upheaval, President Arce hailed the retreat as a democratic victory. Bolivians <a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" href="https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-military-coup-arce-zuniga-arrest-568a17444e3356bce9812b7979e933f4">rallied to denounce the attempted coup</a> and, for a moment, it appeared the tumult might bring the polarized nation together.</p>
     

<p>But within hours, the conversation in Bolivia turned to whether a coup had occurred at all.</p><p>Before being hauled off to jail, Z&#250;&#241;iga claimed his mutiny was a hoax concocted by President Arce to deflect attention from a spiraling economy and <a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" href="https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-morales-arce-political-economic-crisis-d38051e051a2e6473a18133e4a9c6120">a bitter political battle</a> with his former mentor, ex-President Evo Morales. Arce strongly denies the allegations, which remain unsubstantiated.</p><p>Bolivians dissected the face-to-face confrontation between Arce and Z&#250;&#241;iga outside the presidential palace that triggered the general&#8217;s withdrawal, offering a variety of reasons for why the attempted coup appeared staged. </p><p>&#8220;It was a kind of theater,&#8221; said retired Gen. Brig. Omar Cordero Balderrama. &#8220;It&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve ever seen a military coup being broadcast live on television. With coups, everyone knows the first thing to be taken over is the media.&#8221;</p><p>Skeptical experts have also weighed in. </p><p>&#8220;Having had my own brief experience as head of state, I can tell you that you don&#8217;t just take an elevator down 16 floors to chat with the guy who moved tanks to your gates,&#8221; said Eduardo Rodr&#237;guez Veltz&#233;, who briefly served as president of Bolivia in 2005-2006.</p>
     

<p>Many found it strange that the mutiny wrapped up so neatly after just a few hours. It struck them as suspicious that the chief of the armed forces, Gonzalo Vigabriel S&#225;nchez, was nowhere to be seen as chaos consumed the capital, emerging only after Z&#250;&#241;iga&#8217;s sacking to attend a hasty swearing-in ceremony of new appointees where President Arce asked him to remain in his post.</p><p>&#8220;If it was a coup, the presidency would have purged the armed forces,&#8221; said Col. Jorge Santiesteban, a Bolivian security expert. &#8220;The president rewarded the commander-in-chief who didn&#8217;t do anything about a major insurrection committed by his subordinate.&#8221;</p><p>It was also odd that the rebellion was led by Z&#250;&#241;iga, a loyalist who owes his position and high rank to President Arce.</p><p>Photos of Arce and Z&#250;&#241;iga shooting hoops together just days before June 26 splattered across social media. As rumors swirled about their close friendship, senior Cabinet member Mar&#237;a Nela Prada went on Bolivian TV, unprompted, to say the two are not brothers-in-law.</p>
     

<p>Fueling the skepticism is a deep distrust in Bolivian authorities, in part stemming from unresolved tensions over former President Morales&#8217; <a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" href="https://apnews.com/article/e4e1977c3e48426f927ce900d2818b4f">2019 ouster under military pressure</a> that unleashed <a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" href="https://apnews.com/article/0c4ccfe4b7a8409ba37d3b52423a81aa">lethal crackdowns on protests by security forces</a>.</p><p>&#8220;It was up to Arce to make reforms that would counter the impunity, but the president did the opposite,&#8221; said Juan Ram&#243;n Quintana, minister of the presidency under Morales. &#8220;He has deeply damaged military procedures and aggravated an institutional crisis.&#8221;</p><p>Following the June 26 events, former President Morales seized on the opportunity to discredit his rival, <a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" href="https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-coup-accusation-arce-morales-b0051f5a98fdd7ec5ba212bbe49d9850">amplifying the claims against Arce</a>. And in an ironic twist, Argentina&#8217;s <a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" href="https://apnews.com/article/javier-milei-profile-argentina-election-82488d49cca5aee10d4b911bde530922">libertarian President Javier Milei</a> found himself agreeing with socialist Morales, accusing Arce of fabricating the coup attempt, citing undisclosed intelligence.</p>
     

<p>At a press conference late Wednesday, Government Minister Eduardo del Castillo presented further details about what he described as Z&#250;&#241;iga&#8217;s veritable, albeit shambolic, attempt to overthrow the government. He also claimed Z&#250;&#241;iga had sought to burnish his political credentials in recent weeks, touring the country and referring to himself as &#8220;planetary leader.&#8221; </p><p>At least 30 people have now been arrested in connection with last week&#8217;s plot, most of them in pre-trial detention or under house arrest. Accused officers have offered accounts that fueled even stranger conspiracy theories.</p><p>The former commander of the Bolivian Air Force, Gen. Marcelo Zegarra, told prosecutors that Z&#250;&#241;iga enjoyed support from three diplomatic missions in La Paz &#8212; the U.S, the European Union and, interestingly, Libya.</p><p>The north African country has no embassy in Bolivia. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday she had seen &#8220;false allegations&#8221; and wanted &#8220;to make sure it&#8217;s clear that the United States had no involvement in this.&#8221; The EU has not responded publicly.</p><p>Del Castillo said authorities hadn&#8217;t found evidence of foreign involvement.</p><p>Worn out by the fog of contradictory accounts and confusion, some Bolivians are throwing up their hands and tuning it all out.</p><p>In La Paz Tuesday, crowds converged over a hulking 380-kilogram (838-pound) mass of sliced pork and pickled carrots stuffed into a gigantic bun &#8212; Bolivia&#8217;s bid to clinch the world record for the biggest &#8220;sandwich de chola&#8221; ever made.</p><p>&#8220;Our roasted pork with its crunchy skin,&#8221; mused one attendee, Sof&#237;a Molina, as she took a steaming bite. &#8220;That represents us.&#8221;</p><h2>___</h2><p>DeBre reported from Buenos Aires, Argentina</p><h2>__</h2>
