					<div><p>Netherlands have been here before and know how to progress. Indeed, they have got through five of their last seven major tournament quarter-finals &#8212; although they didn&#8217;t make it through their previous one, losing on penalties to eventual 2022 World Cup winners, Argentina.</p><p>As for the European Championship, this is the Dutch&#8217;s first quarter-final since Euro 2008, when they lost 3-1 to Russia.</p><p>In fact, Netherlands have only progressed from three of their last nine knockout ties at a Euros. </p><p>The only other time they have made it through two knockout ties in a single European Championship was 1988, in Germany &#8212; and they went on to win it. </p><p>Here we go then. Another meeting between Netherlands and Turkey; the 15th in international football. So far we&#8217;ve had:</p><ul><li><strong>Netherlands wins: 6</strong></li><li><strong>Turkey wins: 4 </strong></li><li><strong>Draws: 4 </strong></li></ul><p>That said, this is the first time the pair has met in a major tournament.</p><p>The previous two matches have brought 13 goals. Turkey won 4-2 in March 2021, with Netherlands winning 6-1 in September 2021 &#8212; both taking place in 2022 World Cup qualifying.</p><p>Come the end of the round of 16, we were 86 per cent through Euro 2024 and yet our collective memories of this tournament are only just beginning to be formed. </p><p>The moments that will linger longest are far more likely to occur at the end of the knockout stage.</p><p>That is exciting&#8230; But what of the 44 games that went before, and the performances that decorated them?</p><p>We at <strong>The Athletic </strong>think it&#8217;s important to acknowledge the players who lit up the early stages of the tournament &#8212; so let us take you through our best XI made up of players who excelled, but also missed out on a place in the quarter-finals.</p><p>And if you think we&#8217;ve missed someone, set it straight by telling us in an email to: <strong>livebloguk@theathletic.com</strong></p><p>Still, this was no mean feat and brilliantly delivered by our own Jacob Whitehead. Enjoy!</p><p>While Netherlands vs Turkey here in Berlin completes the four Euro 2024 quarter-finals, the third tie takes place in the coming hours &#8212; kicking off in 30 minutes in Dusseldorf, in fact.</p><p>It&#8217;s a stuttering but defensively solid England against a free-flowing Switzerland, who accounted for the exit of defending champions Italy in the round of 16. </p><p>The winner of this one will await either Netherlands or Turkey in the semi-finals, on Wednesday in Dortmund.</p><p>It promises to be a captivating occasion today, and you&#8217;ll be able to follow all the action in Dusseldorf closely, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/live-blogs/england-switzerland-live-updates-euro-2024-score-result/uCZPaFMiQMFb/" target="_self">right here</a>.</p><p>Turkey&#8217;s supporters have raucously followed their team around Germany and helped get their team over the line against Austria.</p><p>On Friday, Ronald Koeman was unsurprisingly grilled about their impact and the Netherlands boss said his side would attempt to keep things &#8220;business-like&#8221;:</p><p>&#128172; <strong>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got some experience against Turkish teams, the atmosphere is always great. We just need to keep the ball and they will become quiet. You need to be cool, business-like and play your game.&#8221;</strong></p><p>The build-up to today&#8217;s game has been rather overshadowed by a growing diplomatic row over a controversial, apparent hand gesture made by Merih Demiral in Turkey&#8217;s win over Austria.</p><p>On Friday, Demiral was handed a two-game suspension by UEFA after appearing to make an ultranationalist salute while celebrating his second goal in Tuesday&#8217;s Euro 2024 last-16 match.</p><p>The 26-year-old celebrated his second goal in the game by making the &#8220;wolf salute&#8221; &#8212; a gesture associated with the far-right extremist group Grey Wolves, who are linked to the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), Turkey&#8217;s ruling coalition party.</p><p>The gesture, made after the second goal, is not illegal in Germany but it is in Austria, where it is punishable with a fine of up to &#8364;4,000 (&#163;3,400; $4,300). The Turkish nationalist hand signal is also banned in France.</p><p>France will face Spain in the Euro 2024 semi-finals after defeating Portugal 5-3 on penalties.</p><p>Anyone tuning into the first half after the pulsating Germany vs Spain quarter-final was rapidly brought down to earth as Portugal and France played out a largely underwhelming opening 45 minutes. </p><p>The teams&#8217; combined expected goals total at half-time was 0.15, the lowest at any match at Euro 2024.</p><p>The second half opened up a little but it ended goalless after 90 minutes, while extra-time &#8212; like the first half &#8212; was an elapsed period of time in which not very much happened.</p><p>France scored all five penalties in the shootout, while Joao Felix missed for Portugal.</p><p>Tim Spiers, Liam Tharme and Amy Lawrence break down the talking points from Hamburg.</p><p>It was the quarter-final that could &#8212; perhaps should &#8212; have been the final, and it did not disappoint.</p><p>Spain thought they had beaten Germany after Dani Olmo&#8217;s 51st-minute finish to a fine team move. </p><p>But Julian Nagelsmann&#8217;s side stuck with it and found an equaliser one minute from time through Florian Wirtz &#8212; owing to a throw-in from goalkeeper Manuel Neuer.</p><p>That took the contest to extra time, where the tournament hosts were denied a penalty in seemingly controversial circumstances. Then, improbably, it was Spain substitute Mikel Merino who decided this match with a fine 119th-minute header.</p><p>Our writers Dermot Corrigan, James McNicholas, Mark Carey and Sebastian Stafford-Bloor break down the action below. </p><p>This always promised to be one of the more frenetic nights at Euro 2024 &#8212; and <strong>Austria vs Turkey </strong>did not disappoint.</p><p>A dramatic start that saw Turkey take the lead inside a minute. Relentless attacking. A miraculous late save. Plus a feisty atmosphere that occasionally bubbled over into something more sinister. </p><p>It all made for a compelling last-16 match. </p><p>Ultimately, Turkey did enough to secure a quarter-final against the Netherlands in Berlin tomorrow.</p><p>Tim Spiers, Mark Carey and Tom Burrows dissected this one.</p><p>Holders <strong>Italy </strong>limped into the round of 16 but their luck finally ran out against <strong>Switzerland </strong>in Berlin last weekend.</p><p>Luciano Spalletti&#8217;s team were outfought, outthought and outplayed &#8212; Italy could have no complaints over heading home.</p><p>Switzerland were as stylish as their head coach Murat Yakin throughout and will now face England tomorrow, while the ramifications in Rome and beyond will be lengthy.</p><p><strong>The Athletic</strong>&#8217;s James Horncastle, Mark Carey and Michael Cox analysed the key talking points below.</p><p>We&#8217;ve now had 46 matches played at Euro 2024 &#8212; and we are in the midst of our last-eight ties.</p><p>Today sees the conclusion of whittling down the final eight to four, ahead of two midweek semi-finals in just a few days&#8217; time. Today&#8217;s matches should also be fascinating clashes, on what many people see as the weaker side of the Euro 2024 draw.</p><p>Here&#8217;s the full line-up for the last-eight ties and how it currently looks:</p><p><strong>Yesterday: </strong></p><ul><li><strong>SPAIN 2-1 Germany</strong> &#8212; A wonderful Merino header wins it for Spain in the final minutes of extra time. </li><li><strong>Portugal 0-0 FRANCE</strong> &#8212; After a goalless 120 minutes, France win 5-3 on penalties.  </li></ul><p><strong>Today:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>England vs Switzerland</strong> &#8212; 5pm BST / 12pm EDT </li><li><strong>Netherlands vs Turkey</strong> &#8212; 8pm BST / 3pm EDT</li></ul></div>
