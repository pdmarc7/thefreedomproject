					<div><p>U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly is being floated as a candidate for vice president now that President Joe Biden has stepped aside, but his nomination could have a major impact on elections in Arizona in the coming years.&#160;
</p><p>While an Arizonan on the presidential ticket could be energizing for voters in the state, it could mean another Senate race &#8211; the state&#8217;s sixth in as many election cycles.&#160;
</p><p>Kelly could stay in the seat while running for vice president, but if the hypothetical Harris-Kelly ticket won in November, Gov. Katie Hobbs would be tasked with appointing his successor until a special election could be held in 2026. Then, candidates would have to compete for a full term in the seat in 2028.&#160;</p> 
<p>Kelly and his wife, former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, have already endorsed Harris, but haven&#8217;t commented further. A spokesperson for his campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&#160;
</p><p>&#8220;[Harris] has my support for the nomination, and Gabby and I will do everything we can to elect her President of the United States,&#8221; Kelly said in a post on X.
</p><p>Hobbs released a statement Monday pledging her support for Harris. Her press secretary Liliana Soto said the governor&#8217;s office will not be commenting further on Biden leaving the race or speculation related to vice presidential candidates.</p> 
<p>In every election since 2016, Arizona voters have seen a U.S. Senate race on their ballots. In 2016, Sen. John McCain was reelected, but passed away in 2018 and was replaced by Jon Kyl.&#160;
</p><p>In 2018, Kyrsten Sinema beat Martha McSally for Arizona&#8217;s second Senate seat, but McSally was appointed to Kyl&#8217;s seat when he resigned in 2018. Kelly then defeated McSally in a special election for McCain&#8217;s seat and won the seat&#8217;s regularly scheduled election in 2022.&#160;
</p><p>Now U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego and former gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake are facing off for the state&#8217;s fifth consecutive Senate race. The winner of that contest will have to defend their seat in 2030, making it the eighth consecutive Senate race in Arizona.
</p><p>In November, Arizona will have elected its seventh senator since 2016. Paul Bentz, senior vice president of research and strategy at HighGround Public Affairs, says the Senate races in Arizona in recent years have been high profile and watched across the country.
</p><p>&#8220;These have been high spending, very public races for the last few cycles, with a lot of money being spent and dominating the airwaves,&#8221; Bentz said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve certainly seen voter fatigue when it comes to those types of elections.&#8221;
</p><p>He said a race to fill Kelly&#8217;s seat would likely be one of those high profile races, given that &#8220;the road to the White House goes through Arizona, and the road to control of the Senate probably goes through Arizona as well.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;Nationally it puts Arizona at the forefront, because there&#8217;s a strong chance that, once again, the fate of the Senate might be in the balance,&#8221; Bentz said.&#160;
</p><p>Other political figures are rumored to be on the shortlist for Harris&#8217; running mate, including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigeg, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was also mentioned as a potential candidate, but has said she isn&#8217;t interested in leaving her state.&#160;
</p><p>Bentz said he thinks Kelly is beloved in Arizona and would likely appeal to voters nationwide with his astronaut background and his marriage to Giffords, but he said a Kelly vice presidency is ultimately &#8220;a long shot.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not as well known, he hasn&#8217;t been on the political scene as long, he&#8217;s not as polished,&#8221; Bentz said.&#160;
</p><p>It&#8217;s unclear whether a vice presidential pick could come before the Democratic National Convention, which will be held in Chicago starting Aug. 19.&#160;
</p><p>The Arizona senator leveraged his career as an astronaut to build a brand as a moderate in a state that long supported Republicans.
</p><p>In his two campaigns &#8212; the first in 2020 to finish the term of the late Republican Sen. John McCain and the second two years later for a full term &#8212; Kelly has earned more votes than any other Democrat on the ballot. He outpolled Biden, who narrowly won Arizona, by 2 percentage points in 2020.
</p><p>Kelly&#8217;s first turn in the national political spotlight came through tragedy. Giffords, was shot in the head while meeting with constituents outside a grocery store in Tucson. The shooting left six people dead and spawned an early reckoning with political violence and partisan rancor.
</p><p>Giffords&#8217; survival made her a national inspiration but snuffed out a promising political career of her own. She and Kelly went on to found a gun-control advocacy group, and Giffords has been a powerful surrogate as Kelly has taken her place in politics.
</p><p>In the Senate, Kelly has focused on national security and the military as well as the drought plaguing the U.S. West. He was instrumental in crafting the CHIPS and Science Act, a bill signed by Biden to boost U.S. semiconductor manufacturing.
</p><p>Kelly was a Navy test pilot and flew 39 combat missions during the Gulf War before joining NASA, where he flew three missions on the space shuttle.
</p><p>Originally from New Jersey, he settled with Giffords in Tucson after retiring from NASA and the Navy.
</p><p>Unlike Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who was elected as a Democrat two years before Kelly but later left the party to become an independent, Kelly has managed to retain the support of the party&#8217;s grassroots base without alienating independent voters. &#8212;
