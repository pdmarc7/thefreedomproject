					<div><p class="story-text ">Some said Biden should step aside. Others said he should stay the course.</p><h2 class="h2-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"><b>Julia Asherman, 37, Twiggs County:</b></h2><p class="story-text ">Julia Asherman, a Middle Georgia vegetable farmer, described Biden&#8217;s debate performance as &#8220;extremely painful&#8221; to watch. She believes he &#8220;is visibly on the decline&#8221; and should step aside for a new nominee who offers &#8220;something fresh.&#8221;</p><p class="story-text ">&#8220;We need something that&#8217;s not just in opposition to Trump,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We need something that we actually have some hope for. I want to feel hopeful. I don&#8217;t want to feel despairing. I feel pretty despairing right now.&#8221;</p><p class="story-text ">Asherman, who lives just east of Macon, hopes party leaders are listening. &#8220;I&#8217;m very concerned that what the people want is not going to filter up.&#8221;</p><p class="story-text ">She also hopes Biden is reconsidering. &#8220;If you know you&#8217;re not the best one for the job, and if everyone doesn&#8217;t feel confident, then you gracefully bow out and your legacy will be remembered for not (expletive) the country for the rest of eternity.&#8221;</p><p class="story-text ">&#8220;If he&#8217;s not mentally capable, if he&#8217;s not in control himself, it makes us ask the question, &#8216;Who is actually in control behind the scenes?&#8217; And that person needs to be elected.&#8221;</p><p class="story-text ">Asherman said his troubling showing onstage that night &#8220;almost validates&#8221; Republican criticism of Biden, that he is too old and can&#8217;t handle the grind of the office.</p><p class="story-text ">&#8220;Up until the debate,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I was, like, &#8216;Maybe they&#8217;re just being mean and unkind,&#8217; and then I saw it and I was, like, &#8216;This is who&#8217;s going to do all the negotiations on behalf of our country with other world leaders?&#8217;&#8221;</p><h2 class="h2-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"><b>Dwayne Marshall, 50, Savannah:</b></h2><p class="story-text ">Dwayne Marshall, an investment consultant, said his support for Biden has not wavered since the debate.</p><p class="story-text ">&#8220;I think, at the end of the day, President Biden has done well by this country in his three and a half years thus far in office,&#8221; Marshall said. &#8220;I still have confidence in him. I still have belief in his ability to lead the country forward for the next four years. I&#8217;m still a big believer in the Biden-Harris administration and I still believe that he is the best leader for our country at this moment.&#8221;</p><p class="story-text ">Marshall said Biden&#8217;s debate performance might have raised questions about his health, but he&#8217;s confident the administration will address them and the president will remain on the ballot.</p><p class="story-text ">&#8220;I think anyone who looked at the debate last Thursday would naturally have some questions that they would want to see answered about the health of the president, but I believe those will be answered in the next couple of days,&#8221; Marshall said. &#8220;I still believe that he is our best leader for this moment in time, to carry us forward and to carry us to, hopefully, a successful outcome in November.&#8221;</p><h2 class="h2-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"><b>Eric Sweeney, 58, Atlanta:</b></h2><p class="story-text ">Eric Sweeney was wearing a Biden shirt while watching the AJC Peachtree Road Race in Atlanta.</p><p class="story-text ">But the self-described &#8220;partisan Democrat&#8221; rated Biden&#8217;s debate performance &#8220;a zero.&#8221; He said the president is &#8220;absolutely&#8221; too old to serve a second term and should &#8220;100 percent&#8221; let someone else be at the top of the ticket.</p><p class="story-text ">&#8220;And while I love the idea of an open process, I think the pushback from not going with (Vice President) Kamala (Harris) will be too tough and I also think, from my understanding, it&#8217;s just easier to transfer the money machine and the apparatus to Kamala. So, I just think that&#8217;s the easiest and obvious choice.&#8221;</p><p class="story-text ">Either way, he&#8217;ll vote for the Democratic candidate because he thinks Trump is &#8220;dangerous.&#8221;</p><h2 class="h2-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"><b>Kimberly Alexander, 54, Hampton:</b></h2><p class="story-text ">Kimberly Alexander plans to vote Democrat and thinks Biden should remain atop the Democrat ticket even though she only rated his debate delivery &#8220;about a four and a half.&#8221;</p><p class="story-text ">She said she grew up in Delaware, Biden&#8217;s home state, which he represented as a U.S. senator, and that he came to her history class. &#8220;So the integrity that he has, I don&#8217;t know that by opinion, I know that by personal contact.&#8221;</p><p class="story-text ">Alexander allowed she might be &#8220;a little less biased&#8221; about age in part because she&#8217;s older too. But she also thinks it would be disruptive to switch candidates now.</p><p class="story-text ">&#8220;That would be really hard for the country to recover from because he has such a strong knowledge base. FDR couldn&#8217;t walk but he was able to lead. Reagan was extremely old but he had a solid team,&#8221; she said.</p><p class="story-text ">Alexander also thinks it&#8217;s in Biden&#8217;s &#8220;DNA to do what&#8217;s best for the nation&#8221; and to be &#8220;openminded, to hear feedback.&#8221;</p><p class="story-text ">Biden also has &#8220;surrounded himself with solid, competent people so I&#8217;m less concerned. And to be frank, his competitor is no spring chicken either.&#8221;</p><h2 class="h2-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"><b>Jaylen Prescott, 23, Monroe County:</b></h2><p class="story-text ">&#8220;I see a decline in his cognitive abilities,&#8221; said Jaylen Prescott, a recent college graduate who lives in the city of Forsyth, just north of Macon, and is a likely Democratic voter this fall.</p><p class="story-text ">Prescott, who majored in biology at Kennesaw State University, might still vote for Biden if he stays in the race, but would prefer &#8220;a better candidate.&#8221;</p><p class="story-text ">&#8220;I think anybody over the age of, like, 65 should not be able to run for president, honestly. &#8230; He doesn&#8217;t seem like he can make a full thought and make a full sentence, and I don&#8217;t feel like that&#8217;s somebody that I personally can support if they can&#8217;t even relay a message.&#8221;</p><p class="story-text ">Might he consider Harris as the party&#8217;s nominee?</p><p class="story-text ">&#8220;According to what I&#8217;ve seen in the polls,&#8221; Prescott said, &#8220;a lot of people don&#8217;t really care for her. I don&#8217;t think she can win.&#8221;</p><h2 class="h2-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"><b>Maria Morales, 44, Sugar Hill:</b></h2><p class="story-text ">Maria Morales said she was still processing Biden&#8217;s debate performance a week after it happened.</p><p class="story-text ">&#8220;I guess you could say I&#8217;m in denial of like, this is what we have today.&#8221;</p><p class="story-text ">But she thinks he should step aside for another candidate on the Democratic ticket. Who that would be, she&#8217;s not sure.</p><p class="story-text ">As for Trump, &#8220;I think, you know, he has this power over certain people and I really would love for him to use that to unite us and to better the country instead of singling people out.&#8221;</p><p class="story-text ">Who will she vote for in November?</p><p class="story-text ">&#8220;At this moment, I can&#8217;t answer that.&#8221;</p><h2 class="h2-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"><b>Amber Luttrell, 46, West Georgia, and Hope Allen, 42, Paulding County:</b></h2><p class="story-text ">Amber Luttrell and Hope Allen, who ran in the AJC Peachtree Road Race, are both planning to vote for Trump. They also think Biden should step down.</p><p class="story-text ">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think (Biden&#8217;s) age has anything to do with it. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s mentally fit to serve another term,&#8221; said Luttrell.</p><p class="story-text ">She&#8217;s also not a fan of Harris.</p><p class="story-text ">&#8220;I don&#8217;t like her at all. I think that she doesn&#8217;t take things seriously. She laughs and giggles inappropriately,&#8221; Luttrell said, adding that Harris hasn&#8217;t done enough to protect the U.S. border.</p><p class="story-text ">Allen also questions Biden&#8217;s mental faculties and thinks Harris &#8220;has not accomplished one thing&#8221; as vice president.</p><h2 class="h2-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"><b>Kevin Randolph, 60, Atlanta:</b></h2><p class="story-text ">Kevin Randolph rated Biden&#8217;s debate performance a &#8220;zero&#8221; and thinks Biden &#8220;definitely&#8221; should let someone else be at the top of the Democratic ticket.</p><p class="story-text ">&#8220;Too old! Narcolepsy!&#8221; he said of Biden, adding that 40s and 50s is &#8220;the prime age&#8221; to be president because of the long hours and stress.</p><p class="story-text ">Who should replace Biden?</p><p class="story-text ">&#8220;Maybe Ralph Nader, an independent. We need someone not affiliated with all the corporations. It&#8217;s becoming about corporations now, more than people.&#8221;</p><p class="story-text ">What about Harris?</p><p class="story-text ">&#8220;She put a whole lot of Black men in prison as a prosecutor. She was part of the problem, not the solution.&#8221;</p><h2 class="h2-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"><b>Gina Ippolito, 34, Savannah:</b></h2><p class="story-text ">Gina Ippolito, a restaurant manager, said Biden is not her ideal candidate but she thinks it&#8217;s too late in the race to replace him as the Democratic nominee.</p><p class="story-text ">The debate &#8220;didn&#8217;t go well at all&#8221; for Biden or Trump, Ippolito said, adding that &#8220;it definitely wasn&#8217;t a confidence-boosting moment for Biden, but I&#8217;m definitely voting blue. For me it&#8217;s very polarized right now and I&#8217;d rather take the Democratic candidate, whoever it is.&#8221;</p><p class="story-text ">Ippolito isn&#8217;t sure how much a different candidate would change the outcome at this point.</p><p class="story-text ">&#8220;I think this is our best chance,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m in desperation mode at this point. And then maybe in the next four years we can get smart and really try to figure out what&#8217;s next, but it&#8217;s just a little bit too late in my opinion.&#8221;</p><h2 class="h2-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"><b>Carolyn Brown, 69, retired office worker, Macon:</b></h2><p class="story-text ">Carolyn Brown watched Biden in his recent debate with Trump and found Biden&#8217;s performance &#8220;heartbreaking.&#8221;</p><p class="story-text ">&#8220;You see the will, you see the desire, you see what he&#8217;s wanting to do for the country,&#8221; Brown said, &#8220;but I just feel like it would be in his best interest and everybody else&#8217;s to graciously bow out.&#8221;</p><p class="story-text ">Brown, a retired BellSouth office worker and former bank teller, will likely vote for the Democratic nominee in the general election. Whoever that may be.</p><p class="story-text ">She thinks the party needs to find someone who can go toe-to-toe with Trump.</p><p class="story-text ">&#8220;It&#8217;s very scary,&#8221; she said, referring to the prospect of a second Trump presidency. &#8220;He has no restraints. And when you look at a person that&#8217;s already conniving, already deceptive, and now with the leniency that he&#8217;s gotten from the Supreme Court, I feel like he would turn that into exactly what he&#8217;s wanting, a dictatorship.&#8221;</p><h2 class="h2-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"><b>Edward Stephens, 38, Athens:</b></h2><p class="story-text ">Edward Stephens didn&#8217;t watch the presidential debate. He was busy, but it wasn&#8217;t necessary because he already has his mind made up.</p><p class="story-text ">&#8221;The Democrats could run a log, and I would vote for it in this election,&#8221; said Stephens, who works for an e-commerce business.</p><p class="story-text ">He admits he doesn&#8217;t like the Biden-Trump rematch. He&#8217;d rather &#8220;someone from the younger generation&#8221; be the Democratic candidate because Biden &#8220;maybe is past his prime-ability age.&#8221;</p><p class="story-text ">Stephens says he would support Harris, Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg or anybody else on the Democratic &#8220;roster&#8221; if they took Biden&#8217;s place as the nominee. But he thinks it isn&#8217;t time for that yet.</p><p class="story-text ">&#8221;It&#8217;s awfully late in the game,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think it has the potential to backfire and leave us more vulnerable (if Biden remains in the race), but I don&#8217;t think any infighting is going to do the party any favors.&#8221;</p><p class="story-text ">Stephens said he could have considered a Republican candidate. But not Trump. That&#8217;s a non-starter.</p><p class="story-text ">&#8221;I think there is a lot of cowardice among many Republican leaders nationwide in allowing a criminal, a liar, someone who is completely unfit to do anything but serve his own self interests to run for the position with the highest responsibility in this country,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That is infuriating to me.&#8221;</p><h2 class="h2-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"><b>Jackie Weaver, in her 60s, Alto:</b></h2><p class="story-text ">Jackie Weaver voted for Trump in the 2016 presidential election, remaining aligned with the Republican Party she supported for roughly five decades.</p><p class="story-text ">Trump&#8217;s first term killed off her lifelong association with the political party. Weaver remains a Biden backer, even after his debate performance.</p><p class="story-text ">&#8221;Trump lied to me once,&#8221; Weaver said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to be lied to again.&#8221;</p><p class="story-text ">Weaver said she was &#8220;quite depressed&#8221; about the debate. She admits it &#8220;did not go well&#8221; for Biden.</p><p class="story-text ">But she contends Trump&#8217;s falsehoods during the showdown, such as stating that Biden supports late-term abortions and that his policies have created jobs only for people in the U.S. illegally, made it impossible for Biden to reasonably discuss topics.</p><p class="story-text ">&#8221;How do you respond to such outrageous lies?&#8221; Weaver said. &#8220;How was he supposed to go back and address this lie and then address the next one? It&#8217;s like dodging bullets from a machine gun.&#8221;</p><p class="story-text ">So Biden should stay atop the ticket?</p><p class="story-text ">&#8220;All the way because of the team. It&#8217;s not just a president you&#8217;re voting for. You&#8217;re voting for a whole team of people.&#8221;</p><h2 class="h2-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"><b>Chris Hairie, 52, Macon:</b></h2><p class="story-text ">Aside from, say, Michelle Obama stepping in as the Democratic nominee for president, Chris Hairie, off the top of his head, had no idea who might be a viable candidate to replace Biden.</p><p class="story-text ">But Hairie, a physical therapist who moved to Middle Georgia from New York state in the 1990s, believes replacing Biden is a must for Democrats, due in large part to the president&#8217;s unsteady appearance and concerns for his health during and after the June 27 debate.</p><p class="story-text ">&#8220;It was not a good look,&#8221; said Hairie, noting that Biden&#8217;s continued candidacy may &#8220;make it much easier for Trump to win.&#8221;</p><p class="story-text ">Hairie, a likely Democratic voter come November, thinks Biden doesn&#8217;t seem as aware of things and wonders &#8220;if he can make quick decisions anymore.&#8221;</p><p class="story-text ">&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why four years ago they didn&#8217;t find a better candidate than Biden,&#8221; Hairie said. &#8220;Given his age and even though he won (in 2020), with him four years older it was going to be a much harder sell.&#8221;</p></div>
