					<div><p>In <a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/story/best-things-to-do-in-iceland" target="_blank">Iceland</a>, there&#8217;s a saying, &#222;etta reddast, used so frequently it&#8217;s often referred to as the nation&#8217;s unofficial motto. It means, roughly, &#8220;it's all going to work out in the end.&#8221;</p><p>When I visited Reykjavik in February&#8212;just a few days after a volcanic eruption cut off hot water to more than <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/volcano-erupts-southwest-iceland-2024-01-14" target="_blank">20,000 people</a>, and about two months after lava forced 4,000 more to permanently evacuate from the fishing village of Grindavik&#8212;one of the questions my tour group first asked <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/haflidi-kristinsson-a2805a197/" target="_blank">Haflidi Kristinsson</a>, our guide, was if he was concerned about the <a class="external-link" href="https://www.visiticeland.com/article/volcanic-activity-reykjanes-peninsula" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">recent surge in Iceland&#8217;s volcanic activity</a>.</p><p>After all, the latest eruption site was located just 25 miles from the nation&#8217;s capital <a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/tag/reykjavik" target="_blank">Reykjavik</a> (where approximately two-thirds of the local population lives), 12 miles from the Keflavik International Airport, and 3 miles from the world-famous tourist attraction, the <a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/grindavik/the-retreat-at-blue-lagoon" target="_blank">Blue Lagoon</a>. Iceland is no stranger to volcanic eruptions, but these were happening much closer to home; until the <a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/story/icelands-volcanic-eruption-has-become-a-reason-to-party" target="_blank">Fagradalsfjall eruption in 2021</a>, the Reykjanes Peninsula&#8217;s volcanic system had remained dormant for the last 800 years. It begs the question: why isn&#8217;t everyone freaking out?</p><p>&#8220;&#222;etta reddast.&#8221;</p><p>This attitude may seem dangerously nonchalant. But perhaps the Icelandic view on the whims of mother nature is necessary when living on the rift of two tectonic plates, alongside <a class="external-link" href="https://www.visiticeland.com/eruption/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">32 active volcanoes</a> that erupt every 3 to 6 years.</p><p>&#8220;Imagine 500 years ago, being a farmer in Iceland. You never knew when a storm was going to hit. You never knew when a volcano was going to erupt and pour ash over your land,&#8221; says Ragnhildur &#193;g&#250;stsd&#243;ttir, the founder of Iceland&#8217;s educational <a class="external-link" href="https://icelandiclavashow.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Lava Show,</a> who is also known to her Instagram followers as <a class="external-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/ragga.ladylava/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Lady Lava</a>. &#8220;There was a lot of uncertainty. And I think this has really affected the mentality of Icelandic people.&#8221;</p><p>Icelanders have survived among such natural uncertainty like this for the thousand-plus years the island has been inhabited. Not only have they thrived in spite of volcanoes, but because of them&#8212;by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-02-28/the-impacts-of-iceland-s-bold-clean-energy-investments" target="_blank">harnessing the geothermal energy</a> of volcanoes to heat homes, provide affordable electricity, and <a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/story/the-lasting-memory-of-icelands-underground-bread" target="_blank">even bake bread</a>, Iceland has become &#8203;&#8203;the <a class="external-link" href="https://www.government.is/topics/business-and-industry/energy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">largest green energy producer per capita</a> in the world.</p><p>In the beginning, the reawakening of the Reykjanes Peninsula&#8217;s volcanic system in 2021 was a gift to Iceland&#8217;s tourism economy, drawing hundreds of thousands of visitors to the smoldering lava field.</p><p>Fagradalsfjall was what they call a &#8220;tourist eruption.&#8221; Effusive fissure eruptions (the non-explosive ones), produce a slow and steady lava flow from cracks in the earth&#8217;s surface, making it easy to observe from a safe distance without worrying about sudden, violent explosions.</p><p>The eruption site in Geldingadalir couldn&#8217;t have been in a better place: a barren valley sealed off by surrounding mountains, containing the lava from nearby towns and roads. But despite its seclusion, it was incredibly easy to access&#8212;only a 35-minute drive from the Keflav&#237;k Airport, travelers could fly to Iceland and be mere feet from flowing lava within a few hours of arriving.</p><p>That year, thousands would gather in the valley&#8217;s ridges, nicknamed the &#8220;amphitheater,&#8221; to watch earth be created in real time. On March 28, 2021, a record-breaking 6,032 visitors were recorded at the eruption site, according to Iceland Tourism.</p><p>It wasn&#8217;t just tourists in the audience either. Kristinsson, who works with luxury travel operator <a class="external-link" href="https://www.abercrombiekent.com/travel-destinations/europe-luxury-travel/iceland" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Abercrombie &amp; Kent</a>, visited the eruption site with his family 37 times over a year and a half. For Iceland&#8217;s tourism professionals, the Fagradalsfjall eruption was a &#8220;winning lottery ticket,&#8221; Kristinsson says. &#8220;It was absolutely the best place possible. The next phase, this phase that's going on now, all of a sudden it was more serious.&#8221;</p><h2>What has changed</h2><p>Iceland has had 8 volcanic eruptions since December 2023, when a new fissure opened approximately 2 miles away from the fishing village of Grindavik (whose 4,000 residents were evacuated the month prior).</p><p>Unlike the previous Fagradalsfjall eruptions, the Grindavik site has remained off-limits to the public out of safety concerns. In January, three of the town&#8217;s homes were engulfed by lava; and in February, scientists recorded magma flow at a record-breaking rate of <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2416365-giant-magma-flow-in-iceland-was-the-fastest-ever-recorded/" target="_blank">7,400 cubic meters per second</a>&#8212;around a hundred times faster than Fagradalsfjall.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/grindavik/the-retreat-at-blue-lagoon" target="_blank">Blue Lagoon</a> closed for two months this winter, and hundreds of guests and staff were evacuated due to eruptions in March and May (it reopened on June 14). The eruption also poses a risk to infrastructure including nearby access roads, hot water pipeline, and power plants.</p><p>The most recent volcanic eruption that began on May 29 lasted for 24 days, forming the <a class="external-link" href="https://en.vedur.is/about-imo/news/volcanic-unrest-grindavik" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">largest lava field</a> so far. <a class="external-link" href="https://en.vedur.is/volcanoes/fagradalsfjall-eruption/hazard-map/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Hazardous areas</a> surrounding active fissures are closed due to risks of unpredictable lava flow, toxic gas, earthquakes, and sinkholes.</p><p>But beyond the closed-off areas, Iceland remains completely safe for tourists&#8212;as long as you follow the local guidelines. There has been no effect on air travel to and from the country, unlike during the 2010 Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull eruption (which took place beneath a glacier, causing abnormally large clouds of ash that <a href="https://skift.com/2023/12/19/how-a-2010-volcanic-eruption-in-iceland-halted-flights/" target="_blank">grounded nearly 100,000 flights across Europe</a>).</p><p>Still, misinformation and confusion has caused some international travelers to cancel trips to Iceland out of fear, Kristinsson says. This year was expected to be a record-breaking year for tourism in Iceland, but as of this winter, bookings are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-28/iceland-tourism-underwhelms-as-prices-volcano-deter-travelers" target="_blank">lagging behind forecasts</a>, reports Bloomberg.</p><p>However, with guidance from locals, travelers can embrace the &#222;etta reddast mindset for themselves. If you plan on visiting Iceland in your lifetime, knowing how to deal with volcanic unpredictability has become somewhat necessary: scientists believe the Reykjanes Peninsula could remain active for the <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/eruption-in-iceland-may-mark-start-of-decades-of-volcanic-activity" target="_blank">next 100 years</a>&#8212;or longer.</p><p>So what&#8217;s the key to the relaxed, yet guarded, sense of respect Icelanders hold for their at-times self-destructive home? It&#8217;s not denying, or ignoring, the reality of volcanoes&#8212;quite the opposite, in fact. Icelanders can recite geology and volcanology facts like the alphabet. The stories of past eruptions are passed through generations in Iceland, from the <a class="external-link" href="https://volcano.uri.edu/lava/LakiEruption/Lakierupt.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">1783 Laki eruption</a> that caused a famine killing <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375310361_More_poison_than_words_can_describe_What_did_people_die_of_after_the_1783_Laki_eruption" target="_blank">an estimated 20 to 25%</a> of Iceland&#8217;s population, to the 1973 Eldfell eruption on the Westman Islands, where Kristinsson&#8217;s wife grew up&#8212;her town was evacuated one night without warning, before more than 400 homes were destroyed or buried by volcanic ash and lava.</p><p>It helps that Iceland is home to some of the world's <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/inside-scientists-life-saving-prediction-of-the-iceland-eruption-20240220/" target="_blank">best volcanologists and forecasting technology</a>. While it&#8217;s still a real possibility to lose a home or an entire town to lava, it&#8217;s now become incredibly rare to be killed by an eruption. Since 1500 AD, there have only been 13 fatalities during eruptions in Iceland, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268299360_Volcanic_hazards_in_Iceland" target="_blank">one study</a> found in 2008. (That number has not changed since.)</p><p>&#8220;All of us who live here know that potentially, a big eruption may happen. But the thing is, we have survived this in the past, and there's no saying that we won't survive it again,&#8221; says &#193;g&#250;stsd&#243;ttir. &#8220;We try to be prepared for when it happens, but we're not too concerned about it. We're not letting it affect our daily lives.&#8221;</p><p>One reason international travelers may find this mindset difficult to understand is that many countries don&#8217;t have the social services in place to create a safety net for citizens displaced by natural disasters, she says. But where Iceland may lack in physical security, it has made up with its social support network. After the majority of residents permanently evacuated Grindavik in November, Iceland&#8217;s government <a class="external-link" href="https://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/news/2024/04/13/the_first_real_estate_purchase_agreements_for_grind/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">agreed to purchase</a> their homes for 95% of the original purchase price in addition to <a class="external-link" href="https://island.is/en/specific-housing-support" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">subsidizing displaced residents&#8217; rent</a> in new homes through the remainder of the year.</p><p>&#8220;Everybody knows that it could happen to any of us at any time,&#8221; says &#193;g&#250;stsd&#243;ttir. &#8220;So we are there for each other.&#8221;</p><p>Visitors may not be able to visit the eruption site near Grindavik right now, but traveling to Iceland at this moment in history offers a different type of volcanic tourism&#8212;that has less to do with watching lava, and more to do with understanding its people.</p><p>For Kristinsson, the eruption site&#8217;s closure creates an opportunity for visitors to explore Iceland&#8217;s less-obvious natural and historical points of interest&#8212;for example, The Westman Islands, which experienced a similar fate to Grindavik following the 1973 eruption.</p><p>By connecting Iceland&#8217;s volcanic history to the current events of today, travelers can learn &#8220;what it means to live in a country like this,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Some of the places you can still visit are time capsules of something that is actually happening right now.&#8221;</p><p>Our fascination with volcanoes&#8212;both their destruction and their beauty&#8212;is primal, &#193;g&#250;stsd&#243;ttir says. &#8220;There's something about the destructive power, how powerless we feel against it,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I mean, it is beautiful. Nobody can deny that.&#8221;</p><h2>Getting close to Iceland's volcanoes</h2><p><strong>The Lava Walk on Westman Islands</strong></p><p>This <a class="external-link" href="https://visitwestmanislands.com/tour/lava-walk-guided-tour/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2-hour hike</a> on the island of Heimaey is led by a local guide over the lava field to the top of the Eldfell Volcano, providing insight into the 1973 eruption and how the people of Vestmannaeyjar were able to rebuild their town.
