They are widely expected to do something they have not done since 2005: Elect a Labour Party government.</p><p>During a hectic final two days of campaigning that saw him visit a food distribution warehouse, a supermarket, a farm and more, Sunak insisted &#8220;the outcome of this election is not a foregone conclusion.&#8221;</p><p>He said Wednesday that whatever the outcome, he had a &#8220;clear conscience.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;As long as I can look myself in the mirror and know that I am working as hard as I can, doing what I believe is right for the country, that is how I get through, and that is what I believe I am doing,&#8221; Sunak said.</p>
    
     


    
     
    
    
    <h1 class="AudioEnhancement-title">
        AP AUDIO: In the UK election campaign&#8217;s final hours, Sunak battles to the end as Labour&#8217;s Starmer eyes victory
    </h1>
    
    
    <p class="AudioEnhancement-description">AP correspondent Jill Lawless reports a strong connection could be forged between the Biden administration and a UK parliament led by Keir Starmer&#8217;s Labour party.</p>
    

     

<p>But even a last-minute pep talk at a Conservative rally Tuesday night by <a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" href="https://apnews.com/article/boris-johnson-what-to-know-faad810ff08e041130e1759cf5a540e7">former Prime Minister Boris Johnson</a> &#8212; who led the party to a thumping election victory in 2019 &#8212; did little to lift the party&#8217;s mood. Conservative Cabinet minister Mel Stride said Wednesday it looked like Labour was heading for an &#8220;extraordinary landslide.&#8221;</p>

 

<p>Labour warned against taking the election result for granted, imploring supporters not to grow complacent about polls that have given the party a solid double-digit lead since before the campaign began. <a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" href="https://apnews.com/article/uk-election-labour-keir-starmer-profile-c420c6b09caf3f9e2d19efc0419e1b12">Labour leader Keir Starmer</a> has spent the six-week campaign urging voters to take a chance on his center-left party and vote for change. Most people, including analysts and politicians, expect they will.</p> 
<p>Labour has not set pulses racing with its pledges to get the sluggish economy growing, invest in infrastructure and make Britain a &#8220;clean energy superpower.&#8221; </p>
     
<p>But nothing has really gone wrong, either. The party has won the support of large chunks of the business community and endorsements from traditionally conservative newspapers including the Rupert Murdoch-owned Sunday Times and tabloid The Sun. The Sun said in an editorial Wednesday that &#8220;by dragging his party back to the center ground of British politics for the first time since Tony Blair was in No.10, Sir Keir has won the right to take charge.&#8221;</p>
     

<p>Former Labour candidate Douglas Beattie, author of the book &#8220;How Labour Wins (and Why it Loses),&#8221; said Starmer&#8217;s &#8220;quiet stability probably chimes with the mood of the country right now.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;The country is looking for fresh ideas, moving away from a government that&#8217;s exhausted and divided,&#8221; Beattie said. &#8220;So Labour are pushing at an open door.&#8221;</p><p>The Conservatives, meanwhile, have been plagued by gaffes. The campaign got off to an inauspicious start when rain drenched Sunak as he <a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" href="https://apnews.com/article/uk-election-speculation-rishi-sunak-bcc72f7f262086e9b20f7dd80f88c91f">made the announcement</a> outside 10 Downing St. on May 22. Then on June 6, Sunak <a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" href="https://apnews.com/article/uk-sunak-election-dday-apology-5f69a8752251874a341fe4ecd9ff9a1c">went home early</a> from commemorations in France marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day invasion, missing a ceremony alongside United States President Joe Biden and France&#8217;s Emmanuel Macron.</p>
     

<p>Several Conservatives close to Sunak are being investigated by the gambling regulator over suspicions they used inside information to <a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" href="https://apnews.com/article/uk-election-betting-police-5860e510aaf5c9e38484ef5a4b7d0ba2">place bets</a> on the date of the election before it was announced.</p><p>It has all made it harder for Sunak to shake off the taint of political chaos and mismanagement that&#8217;s gathered around the Conservatives since Johnson and his staff held <a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" href="https://apnews.com/article/boris-johnson-partygate-parliament-report-takeaways-6b88860329db3f0e968f7e568b957658">lockdown-breaching partie</a> s during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Johnson&#8217;s successor, Liz Truss, rocked the COVID-weakened economy with a package of drastic tax cuts, making a <a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" href="https://apnews.com/article/uk-election-cost-of-living-crisis-inflation-6780ffee1c3f0170ee95fc54f9d53842">cost-of-living crisis worse</a>, and lasted just 49 days in office. There is widespread dissatisfaction over a host of issues, from a dysfunctional public <a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" href="https://apnews.com/article/britain-election-nhs-crisis-nathaniel-dye-a9d6ad4a3b5acd3e35a9acf9b5ee2c5a">health care system</a> to <a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" href="https://apnews.com/article/britain-sewage-water-pollution-uk-england-election-e73177e20412a361783224430b479165">crumbling infrastructure</a>.</p><p>But for many voters, the <a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" href="https://apnews.com/article/uk-election-hartlepool-red-wall-labour-party-a2e217caa7c14b39908f88b7ff1f545a">lack of trust</a> applies not just to Conservatives, but to politicians in general. Veteran rouser of the right, <a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" href="https://apnews.com/article/uk-election-reform-immigration-farage-61f79607dddf9e68eedf65ea14adb162">Nigel Farage</a>, has leaped into that breach with his Reform U.K. party and grabbed headlines, and voters&#8217; attention, with his anti-immigration rhetoric.</p>
     

<p>The centrist <a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" href="https://apnews.com/article/uk-election-liberal-democrats-ed-davey-stunts-9c1da8665c4d3f66c8944800feaad9eb">Liberal Democrats</a> and environmentalist <a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" href="https://apnews.com/article/uk-election-climate-change-green-party-e4456e757db67c6aad4f1f5d340467a6">Green Party</a> also want to sweep up disaffected voters from the bigger parties.</p><p>Across the country, voters say they <a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" href="https://apnews.com/article/uk-election-hartlepool-red-wall-labour-party-a2e217caa7c14b39908f88b7ff1f545a">want change but aren&#8217;t optimistic it will come</a>.</p><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know who&#8217;s for me as a working person,&#8221; said Michelle Bird, a port worker in Southampton on England&#8217;s south coast who was undecided about whether to vote Labour or Conservative. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s the devil you know or the devil you don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p><p>Conner Filsell, a young office worker in the London suburbs, would like a roof of his own.</p><p>&#8220;I still live at home. I would love to be able to have my own place, but the way things are going it&#8217;s just not on the cards,&#8221; he said.</p><p>Lise Butler, senior lecturer in modern history at City University of London, said that signs point to this being &#8220;a change election in which the Conservatives are punished.&#8221; But she said that if Starmer wins, &#8220;the years to come &#8230; may be challenging.&#8221;</p>
     

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll probably be facing constant attacks on various grounds from left and right,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So I think that while the outcome of this election is pretty clear, I think all bets are off in terms of what, what Labour&#8217;s support is going to look like over the next few years.&#8221;</p><p>Starmer has agreed that his biggest challenge is &#8220;the mindset in some voters that everything&#8217;s broken, nothing can be fixed.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;And secondly, a sense of mistrust in politics because of so many promises having been made over the last 14 years which weren&#8217;t carried through,&#8221; he told broadcaster ITV on Tuesday. &#8220;We have to reach in and turn that around.&#8221;</p><p>Many election experts expect a low turnout, below the 67% recorded in 2019. Yet this election may bring a scale of change Britain has not seen for decades if it delivers a big Labour majority and a diminished Conservative Party.</p><p>In Moreton-in-Marsh, a pretty town of honey-colored stone buildings in western England&#8217;s Cotswold hills, 25-year-old Evie Smith-Lomas relished the chance to eject the area&#8217;s longstanding Conservative lawmaker.</p><p>&#8220;This has been a Tory seat forever, for 32 years, longer than I&#8217;ve been alive,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m excited at the prospect of someone new. I mean I think 32 years in any job is too long. You surely have run out of ideas by now.&#8221;</p><h2>___</h2><p>Associated Press video journalist Tian Macleod Ji in Moreton-in-Marsh, England, contributed to this report.</p>
