					<div><p>J.D. Vance&#8217;s weird, anti-woke punchline fell flat at his own sleepy speaking event on Monday. </p><p>Vance held a rally at his former high school in Middletown, Ohio, where hundreds gathered to hear the missives of Donald Trump&#8217;s newly-minted vice presidential candidate. But, even as a hometown hero, the Ohio senator suffered some brutally awkward moments. </p><p>&#8220;It is the weirdest thing to me: Democrats say that it is racist to believe&#8212;well, they say it&#8217;s racist to do anything,&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/Acyn/status/1815454907291627927" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">said</a> Vance. &#8220;I had a diet Mountain Dew yesterday, and one today. I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re probably gonna call that racist, too.&#8221; Around the room there were some scattered laughs.</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good,&#8221; he said after a beat, drawing more polite laughter from the rally attendees. Vance let out his own breathy laugh at his comment, slapping the podium in front of him. &#8220;I love you guys,&#8221; he said, smiling and laughing.</p><p>Vance&#8217;s weak swing at a joke landed as a lazy attempt to score some culture war points. And that wasn&#8217;t the only cringey moment during his time on stage. While there was a lot of laughter throughout Vance&#8217;s 40-minute speech, much of it appeared to come from him. <br></p><p>&#8220;I was told I was going to get to debate Kamala Harris; now President Trump is going to get to debate her?&#8221; Vance <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/22/us/politics/vance-trump-rallies.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">said</a>, laughing again. At one point, he lost his train of thought after the crowd began to boo Harris, and started <a href="https://x.com/Acyn/status/1815455304823575001" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">nervously laughing</a> again. </p><p>While this would escape the interest of any normal person, it&#8217;s worth noting because his running mate has repeatedly <a href="https://x.com/Acyn/status/1814794866507063783" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">called</a> Vice President Kamala Harris &#8220;Laughing Kamala.&#8221; Like Vance&#8217;s quip about diet soda, this approach to criticism seems to stem from having absolutely nothing of substance to say about a subject, but giving it their best shot anyway.</p><p>Overall, the Republican&#8217;s performance was so underwhelming that even Fox News <a href="https://x.com/Acyn/status/1815456384638718448" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">stopped</a> airing coverage of Vance&#8217;s speech in the middle of his remarks. </p><p>Vance&#8217;s speech at the Republican National Convention last week was similarly kind of boring. At the time, it seemed like it could be an intentional play not to overshadow Trump, which the former president famously hates. But with Vance&#8217;s most recent display, it seems that sluggish performance might&#8217;ve been unavoidable. </p>Read more about J.D. Vance:<p>Kamala Harris will most likely not appear beside Benjamin Netanyahu when he speaks to Congress this week. Former senior Biden administration officials <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/not-the-bad-cop-biden-officials-say-harris-wont-shift-course-on-supporting-israel/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">say</a> that was likely by design.</p><p>Harris declined to attend Netanyahu&#8217;s joint address later this week, Axios journalist Juliegrace Brufke <a href="https://x.com/juliegraceb/status/1815445635040006538?s=46" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reported</a> Monday. And the decision was made before Joe Biden announced he was withdrawing from the 2024 race. </p><p>The vice president would have sat directly behind Netanyahu&#8217;s podium during the Wednesday event. Instead, last week, Biden&#8217;s campaign had scheduled her to speak in Indianapolis.</p><p>&#8220;That probably wasn&#8217;t an accident,&#8221; a former senior administration official told <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/not-the-bad-cop-biden-officials-say-harris-wont-shift-course-on-suphttps://www.timesofisrael.com/not-the-bad-cop-biden-officials-say-harris-wont-shift-course-on-supporting-israel/porting-israel/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>The Times of Israel</i></a>. The source theorized that Biden may keep Harris away from the White House while Netanyahu is in town to avoid images that feature Harris associating with the Israeli prime minister. This would mark a <a href="https://x.com/prem_thakker/status/1815456200823021744" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">significant shift</a> in U.S. policy, if appearing with Netanyahu is suddenly <a href="https://theintercept.com/2024/07/21/biden-quit-harris-president-gaza/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">viewed</a> as a bad thing.</p><p>At the same time, Harris is receiving flack from Zionist organizations over <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/kamala-harris-interview-profile-excerpt/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">comments</a> she made about student protests in support of Palestine in an interview with <i>The Nation</i> earlier this month. The Zionist Organization of America <a href="https://x.com/jacobkornbluh/status/1815376879232168236?s=46&amp;t=-7Hv51SE4kQNfBaT_qIWYQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">accused</a> Harris of endorsing &#8220;Arab Islamist criminality,&#8221; among other racist remarks.</p><p>However, a current U.S. official said that a future Harris administration&#8217;s policies on Palestine won&#8217;t differ much from Biden&#8217;s. &#8220;Vice President Harris shares President Biden&#8217;s support for an iron-clad U.S. commitment to Israel&#8217;s security coupled with a commitment to advancing a two-state solution in order to bring an end to this cycle of violence,&#8221; the official <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/not-the-bad-cop-biden-officials-say-harris-wont-shift-course-on-supporting-israel/#:~:text=Vice%20President%20Harris%20shares%20President,%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20a%20US%20official." target="_blank" rel="nofollow">said</a>, speaking anonymously.</p><p>But Biden may also snub Netanyahu. A senior official in his office <a href="https://x.com/BarakRavid/status/1815457908748153056" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">told</a> reporters that Netanyahu may not meet with the U.S. president after all. Meanwhile, a record number of Democrats are set to boycott Netanyahu&#8217;s speech.</p><p>Representative Nancy Pelosi is throwing her &#8220;enthusiastic support&#8221; behind Kamala Harris for president.</p><p>&#8220;Today, it is with immense pride and limitless optimism for our country&#8217;s future that I endorse Vice President Kamala Harris for President of the United States,&#8221; Pelosi wrote <a href="https://x.com/TeamPelosi/status/1815439126512234707" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">in a statement</a> Monday. &#8220;My enthusiastic support for Kamala Harris for President is official, personal and political.&#8221;</p><p>Despite holding off a day longer than other Democrats, the fellow Bay Area politician <a href="https://x.com/TeamPelosi/status/1815438640631492618" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">has</a> made clear she approves of Joe Biden&#8217;s decision to step down and hand the torch to Harris.</p><p>&#8220;Officially, I have seen Kamala Harris&#8217;s strength and courage as a champion for working families, notably fighting for a woman&#8217;s right to choose. Personally, I have known Kamala Harris for decades as rooted in strong values, faith and a commitment to public service,&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;Politically, make no mistake: Kamala Harris as a woman in politics is brilliantly astute&#8212;and I have full confidence that she will lead us to victory in November.&#8221;</p><p>After Biden dropped out, Pelosi and Harris spoke by phone on Sunday, according to <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/22/nancy-pelosi-kamala-harris-democratic-nominee-endorsement" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Axios</a>.</p><p>Though Pelosi never officially called for Biden to step down, she played a critical role in strong-arming him to bow out. Privately, Pelosi warned Biden about the ripple effects for other Democrats on the ballot. Additionally, she appeared on MSNBC&#8217;s <i>Morning Joe</i> saying she wanted Biden &#8220;to do whatever he decides to do,&#8221; while at the time Biden had made clear he planned to remain in the race.</p><p>While much of the Democratic establishment is falling in line behind Harris, those yet to endorse her include former President Barack Obama, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. </p><p>Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris Monday morning and ripped Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance in the process. <br></p><p>Speaking on MSNBC&#8217;s <i>Morning Joe</i><i>,</i> Beshear touted Harris&#8217;s previous record as a prosecutor, saying that she is &#8220;kind and has empathy, which can make her a great president.<br></p><p>&#8220;The contrast between her and those running on the other side couldn&#8217;t be clearer,&#8221; Beshear said, pointing out that Harris prosecuted rapists and abusers, while Vance&#8217;s words about rape were egregious. <br></p><p>&#8220;Vance calls pregnancy arising from rape &#8216;inconvenient.&#8217; No, it&#8217;s just plain wrong,&#8221; Beshear <a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1815377959768789363" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span>said</span></a>. &#8220;He suggests that women should stay in abusive relationships. Listen, a domestic abuser isn&#8217;t a man, he&#8217;s a monster.&#8221;</p><p>Beshear&#8217;s endorsement carries a lot of weight, as he&#8217;s a twice-elected Democratic governor presiding over a red Southern state in Kentucky. He also has been discussed as a <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/183481/democrats-running-mates-kamala-harris"><span>possible vice presidential running mate</span></a> for Harris, even before Biden&#8217;s <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/184061/its-joever-biden-drops-out-2024-presidential-race"><span>withdrawal</span></a> from the presidential election Sunday, and in Monday&#8217;s interview, he <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/22/andy-beshear-endorses-kamala-harris-vp-2024" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span>hinted</span></a> that he would be interested in the role. <br></p><p>&#8220;The only way I would consider something other than this current job is if I believe I could further help my people and to help this country,&#8221; Beshear <a href="https://x.com/RossOKeefe2/status/1815362757492949119" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span>said</span></a>. When pressed further, he added, &#8220;I think if somebody calls you on that, what you do is you at least listen.&#8221;</p><p>Beshear is one of the most <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/177628/andy-beshear-president-democrat-2023"><span>popular governors</span></a> in America. An October poll found that he has the highest net approval rating of any Democratic governor in a red state. As Harris and her campaign decide who would be the ideal running mate for the Democratic ticket, Beshear&#8217;s success in Kentucky can only help his prospects.<br></p>An important read on J.D. Vance:<p>On Monday, Mike Pence praised Biden&#8217;s decision to <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/184082/donald-trump-weaker-kamala-harris"><span>end his presidential bid</span></a> and called for national unity. Despite the normalcy of Pence&#8217;s rhetoric, MAGA posters immediately began blasting the former vice president for his supposed traitorousness.</p><p>&#8220;President Joe Biden made the right decision for our country and I thank him for putting the interests of our Nation ahead of his own,&#8221; Pence <a href="https://x.com/Mike_Pence/status/1815388390784668055" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span>wrote</span></a> on X (formerly Twitter). &#8220;After the assassination attempt on President Trump and President Biden&#8217;s decision to end his campaign, now is a time for leaders in both parties to project calm and send a message of strength and resolve to America&#8217;s friends and enemies alike that, whatever the state of our politics, the American people are strong and our American military stands ready to defend our freedom and our vital national interests anywhere in the world.&#8221; <br></p><p>The statement was a tame call for national unity (albeit with some jingoism peppered in). Pence biographer Tom LoBianco <a href="https://x.com/tomlobianco/status/1815406023621902465" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span>called it</span></a> &#8220;remarkably normal given the tone of things.&#8221; <br></p><p>But Pence has been persona non grata in Trump world since his refusal to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, and his post was flooded with replies deeming his banal call for civility further proof of his turncoat status.</p><p>The conservative interest group the Association of Mature American Citizens <a href="https://x.com/AMACforAmerica/status/1815388782956294293" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span>posted</span></a>, &#8220;Praising Biden, pathetic.&#8221; Conservative commentator Joey Mannarino <a href="https://x.com/JoeyMannarinoUS/status/1815390903395115091" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span>said</span></a>, &#8220;This is why we consider you a traitor, Mike. Fuck off.&#8221; Various other MAGA accounts left comments like, &#8220;Judas Pence has spoken,&#8221; &#8220;You knew what was at risk by certifying a stolen election yet you did it anyway,&#8221; &#8220;We are only in this mess because of you, so shut the fuck up,&#8221; and so on.</p><p>The MAGA outrage over Pence&#8217;s quite ordinary statement reveals his own party&#8217;s limited appetite for the unity he espouses.<br></p>More on the new 2024 race:<p>Republicans may be starting to second-guess their party&#8217;s pick for vice president. </p><p>Much of Donald Trump&#8217;s presidential campaign, including the decision to tap Ohio Senator J.D. Vance as his running mate, was structured around attacks on President Joe Biden. But then Biden announced Sunday that he was withdrawing from the presidential race altogether.</p><p>Trump campaign officials acknowledged that Trump selected the inexperienced Vance, charged with all his <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/183971/jd-vance-weird-terrifying-techno-authoritarian-ideas">techno-authoritarian ideas</a>, to boost support among their own base, not extend a hand to swing voters, according to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/07/trump-campaign-biden-dropping-out/679183/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>The Atlantic</i></a><i>.</i> Vance was a symbol of the Trump team&#8217;s assuredness that they would win in 2024. Come Sunday, that assuredness appears to be shrinking.</p><p>&#8220;Most striking thing I heard from Trump allies yesterday was the second-guessing of JD Vance&#8212;a selection, they acknowledged, that was [born] of cockiness, meant to run up margins with the base in a blowout rather than persuade swing voters in a nail-biter,&#8221; <i>Atlantic</i> staff writer Tim Alberta, who had written the piece about the panicking Trump campaign, <a href="https://x.com/TimAlberta/status/1815377270657237080" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">posted</a> on X (formerly Twitter). </p><p>Trump decried Biden&#8217;s decision to drop out in a post on Truth Social, writing that his team would have to &#8220;start all over again&#8221; and asking to be reimbursed for the cost. At the same time, Vance has set straight to work, calling for Biden to <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/184091/trump-jd-vance-kamala-harris-biden-coup">resign</a> from the presidency. </p><p>Meanwhile, the Democrats possess a new potential nominee in the form of Vice President Kamala Harris. And as a result, the party had <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/184085/kamala-harris-historic-fundraising-worry-trump">one of the best fundraising days</a> ever. </p>Read more about Trump:<p>The MAGA right has a new conspiracy theory about Joe Biden following his announcement to <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/184061/its-joever-biden-drops-out-2024-presidential-race"><span>drop out</span></a> of the presidential race: He is either dead or incapacitated and needs to show &#8220;proof of life.&#8221;</p><p>Many conservative figures are posting that Biden hasn&#8217;t made any public appearances in the last few days, especially since he posted his letter to withdraw Sunday. Representative Lauren Boebert jumped on the conspiracy, <a href="https://x.com/laurenboebert/status/1815369663947198920" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span>insinuating</span></a> that Biden didn&#8217;t make the decision himself but that it was made for him due to his diminished mental state. <br></p><p>Boebert wasn&#8217;t the only member of Congress claiming that Biden&#8217;s absence was <a href="https://x.com/chiproytx/status/1815209649525633113" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span>suspicious</span></a>. <br></p><p>Other right-wing figures saw something nefarious in Biden&#8217;s signature, saying that it was conspicuously different from how the president usually signs documents. <br></p><p>Right-wing tech mogul <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/168125/david-sacks-elon-musk-peter-thiel"><span>David Sacks</span></a> made a reference to the film <i>Weekend at Bernie&#8217;s</i>, where a dead man is propped up and passed off as alive, perfectly summing up what the right <a href="https://x.com/DavidSacks/status/1815182399665496170" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span>thinks about Biden</span></a> right now. <br></p><p>In reality, Biden has been isolating in his vacation home in <a href="https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/local/2024/07/22/where-is-joe-biden-president-makes-campaign-exit-from-rehoboth-beach-delaware/74493530007/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span>Rehoboth Beach</span></a>, Delaware, after being diagnosed with Covid-19 last week. While the decision to make his announcement withdrawing from the race via social media is unusual, perhaps he hasn&#8217;t wanted to make any formal announcements or press conferences from a beach house while sick. In his <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/184061/its-joever-biden-drops-out-2024-presidential-race"><span>announcement Sunday</span></a>, he said he would address the nation later this week. Regardless, conservatives aren&#8217;t posting out of any concern for the president: They&#8217;re going nuts still trying to <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/184091/trump-jd-vance-kamala-harris-biden-coup"><span>process</span></a> Biden&#8217;s decision. <br></p><p>The 2024 presidential race has seen both parties&#8217; nominees bedeviled by concerns about their age and fitness. But after Biden&#8217;s decision to <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/184061/its-joever-biden-drops-out-2024-presidential-race"><span>step aside</span></a> on Sunday, Democrats have shed such concerns&#8212;and the words of Nikki Haley, who railed against gerontocracy during her campaign for the Republican nomination, have come back to haunt Donald Trump.</p><p>Haley was an early observer of the public&#8217;s dissatisfaction with both candidates&#8217; ages, going so far as to predict that fortune would favor the party that first dropped their elderly candidate. After losing the New Hampshire primary in January, Haley took a shot at both presumptive nominees, prophesying that &#8220;the first party to retire its 80-year-old candidate is going to be the party that wins this election.&#8221; <br></p><p>While the 81-year-old Biden has certainly faced the brunt of age concerns recently, a July ABC News/<i>Washington Post</i>/Ipsos <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/ABC-News-Washington-Post-Ipsos-July-2024-Survey" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span>poll</span></a> found that 58 percent of Americans saw both Biden and Trump as &#8220;too old for a second term.&#8221; With Biden out of the race, Haley&#8217;s warning is being <a href="https://x.com/briantylercohen/status/1815155423881953418" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span>widely</span></a> shared by Democrats celebrating the party&#8217;s newfound advantage against Trump, who is now the oldest nominee in U.S. history. <br></p><p>Of course, one wonders whether Haley, who has since &#8220;strongly endorsed&#8221; Trump, maintains her prediction. As to its prescience, we&#8217;ll have to wait until the election draws nearer to see.</p>More on the new 2024 race:</div>
