                                        Deku graduates from U.A. and becomes a teacher in My Hero Academia's finale while his classmates become top heroes.

                    <li>
                                        Deku's final battle leads to societal changes, with civilians helping to lighten the heroes' burdens and transform hero society.

            </ul>

    
        
    

<p>                    After a decade-long run, Kohei Horikoshi's hit superhero series <a href="https://screenrant.com/tag/my-hero-academia/"><strong>My Hero Academia</strong></a> has finally come to an end with the final chapter neatly wrapping the series. After an <a href="https://screenrant.com/my-hero-academia-all-for-one-defeated-ch423/">intense final battle against Shigaraki</a>, Deku's journey toward becoming the greatest hero has finally ended with chapter #430 concluding the story's epilogue at last&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;.
    </p>

    
<p>                    In My Hero Academia's finale, Deku goes back to U.A. after recovering from his injuries and eventually graduates despite losing One For All in the battle against Shigaraki and becoming quirkless again. Chapter #430 fast forwards to eight years later, where <strong>Deku goes on to become a teacher at U.A.</strong> while his fellow classmates go on to become well-known heroes.
    </p>

    
                
    
    
    
                
    
                
        
                                                            
                                                                                                                        
                                                                        
     

<p>                     The final chapter also reveals that the embers of One For All have finally disappeared for good. However, towards the end of the chapter, All Might hands Deku a mechanical suit created by Hatsune Mei and an overseas friend of All Might's, which was funded by the Class 1-A alumni. Armed with the new battle suit, <strong>My Hero Academia's final chapter ends with Deku getting the chance to be a hero once again alongside his friends. </strong>

<p>                    Despite suffering from quite grievous injuries, chapter #424 of My Hero Academia sees Deku returning to U.A. and continuing in the hero course. In the following chapter, Aoyama leaves U.A. and Shinso joins Class 1-A in his stead. Despite having only the fading embers of One For All, Deku continues to study hard along with the fellow young heroes of Class 1-A who are finally seen graduating in chapter #430.
    </p>

    
<p>                    The final chapter reveals that while Deku becomes a teacher at U.A., both Shoto and Bakugo become top heroes despite the latter's temper. Chapter #430 also reveals Shoji has received the Imamura Peace Prize for peacefully resolving conflicts involving discrimination against heteromorphs. Meanwhile, IIda, Asui, Yaoyorozu, and Uraraka are revealed to be touring elementary schools around the country offering quirk counseling. Even Kirishima becomes a very popular hero among men in particular according to Deku.
    </p>

    
<p>                    The chapter also provides an<strong> update on several other side characters like Kouta</strong>, who joins the hero course at U.A., Mei, who starts her own design agency, and La Brava, who starts her own coding company named Gel Inc. <a href="https://screenrant.com/mha-hero-academia-spinner-villain-comic-foreshadowed/">Spinner also published his book</a>, titled "League of Villains", where he tells the story of the final battle, seen from the villains' side. Most importantly, however, chapter #430 also reveals that All Might, who is now old and grey, is still doing well eight years later despite his injuries from the battle against All For One.

<p>                    In the final battle against Shigaraki, <a href="https://screenrant.com/mha-hero-academia-deku-true-hero-tenko-nana-saved/">Deku sacrifices One For All</a> in an attempt to get past the leaden mass of hatred and reach Shigaraki. While he successfully manages to do so, One For All takes control of Shigaraki's body once again, which leads to Class 1-A coming to Deku's aid.
    </p>

    
<p>                    Despite having only the embers of One For All, Deku pushes on against All For One, who notes that it is <strong>Deku's perseverance in spite of his weakness that motivates others to keep fighting</strong>. Thus, the finale reveals that it is not his quirk, but rather his ability to motivate and inspire others that <a href="https://screenrant.com/mha-hero-academia-deku-greatest-hero-meaning-of-premise/">makes Deku the greatest hero</a>, returning to the series' original premise in an unexpected fashion.
    </p>

    
                
    
    
    
                
    
                
        
                                                            
                                                                                                                        
                                                                        
     

<p>                    My Hero Academia's epilogue mirrors this sentiment once again, with Deku encouraging a young boy named Dai that he too can be a hero despite his relatively weak quirk. The young boy mirrors Deku in many ways, from his timid demeanor to the way he also instinctively moves to help another.
    </p>

    
<p>                    His question even reminds Deku of the similar one he posed to All Might at the very start of the series, and much like All Might did back then, <strong>Deku also reassures the young boy that he can be a hero as well</strong>. Thus, while <a href="https://screenrant.com/mha-hero-academia-next-symbol-of-peace-todoroki/">Deku does not become the next Symbol of Peace</a> like All Might, he does become an inspiring figure with his final battle urging quirk society to change down to its very roots.

<p>                    Besides directly inspiring young aspiring heroes like the little boy in the final chapter, My Hero Academia's epilogue also reveals the <strong>impact of Deku's final battle on hero society on a ground level</strong>. As Hawks explains in chapter #429, Deku's final battle and his refusal to give up on Shigaraki demonstrated to society the need to reach out to those in need instead of conveniently ignoring those in pain like Shigaraki.
    </p>

    
<p>                    This lesson extends not only to heroes but also to regular civilians in My Hero Academia, as seen in chapter #429 where an old woman sees a little boy in distress and takes his hand, reminded of the time she ignored a young Tenko on the streets. As such, the finale sees civilians lighten the load on heroes by taking on some of the responsibility to reach out and help others, even if they may be weak or quirkless like Deku.

<p>                    Both quirk society and the pro-hero institution were inherently flawed, but <a href="https://screenrant.com/mha-hero-academia-424-epilogue-different-shonen/">My Hero Academia's epilogue</a> gradually sees the system begin to change, starting with Hawks being appointed as the head of the Hero Public Safety Commission. Even though Shigaraki and the League of Villains went down as evil criminals, the memory of their pain and suffering is kept alive by Deku and Uraraka, with the latter especially making strides with her quirk counseling initiative.
    </p>

    
<p>                    The effect of this collective effort by both heroes and civilians is seen most clearly in the final chapter, where the number of emerging villains is finally decreasing, along with the need for a great number of pro-heroes.
