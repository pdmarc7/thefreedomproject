GEORGE'S, Grenada -- <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " href="https://abc7ny.com/tag/hurricane/">Hurricane Beryl</a> roared through open waters Tuesday as a powerful Category 4 storm heading toward Jamaica after earlier crossing islands in the southeast Caribbean, killing at least six people.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">A hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica, Grand Cayman, Little Cayman, and Cayman Brac. Beryl was losing intensity but was forecast to still be near major-hurricane strength when it passes near or over Jamaica early Wednesday, near the Cayman Islands on Thursday and into Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday, according to the National Hurricane Center.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">A hurricane watch was in effect for Haiti's southern coast and the Yucatan's east coast. Belize issued a tropical storm watch stretching south from its border with Mexico to Belize City.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Late Monday, Beryl became the earliest storm to develop into a <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " href="https://abc7ny.com/weather/hurricane-beryl-upgraded-to-category-5;-at-least-1-killed-by-storm/15016014/">Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic</a> and peaked at winds of 165 mph (270 kph) Tuesday before weakening to a still-destructive Category 4. Early Wednesday, the storm was about 250 miles (400 kilometers) east-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica. It had top winds of 145 mph (230 kph) and was moving west-northwest at 22 mph (35 kph), the center said.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Beryl was expected to bring life-threatening winds and storm surge to Jamaica, where officials warned residents in flood-prone areas to prepare for evacuation.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"I am encouraging all Jamaicans to take the hurricane as a serious threat," Prime Minister Andrew Holness said in a public address Tuesday. "It is, however, not a time to panic."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">In Miami, National Hurricane Center Director Michael Brennan said Jamaica appears to be in the direct path of Beryl.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"We are most concerned about Jamaica, where we are expecting the core of a major hurricane to pass near or over the island," he said in an online briefing. "You want to be in a safe place where you can ride out the storm by nightfall (Tuesday). Be prepared to stay in that location through Wednesday."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Storm surge of 6-9 feet (1.8 to 2.7 meters) above typical tide levels are likely in Jamaica, as well as heavy rainfall.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"This is a big hazard in the Caribbean, especially with the mountainous islands," Brennan said. "This could cause life threatening flash floods and mudslides in some of these areas."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">A tropical storm warning was in place for the entire southern coast of Hispaniola, an island shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic.</p><h2 class="RxNCg PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq">Cruise ships change courses as Hurricane Beryl tears through the Caribbean</h2><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Cruise lines are altering some of their cruises' courses in the Caribbean as Hurricane Beryl storms through the region.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Carnival Cruise Line said Tuesday it was changing the original trajectories of two of their active cruises - Carnival Horizon and Carnival Liberty.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy"><strong class="vtkaO">RELATED:</strong><a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " href="https://abc7ny.com/post/hurricane-beryl-path-explanation-unprecedented-nature/15017143/" target="_blank"> Hurricane Beryl's unprecedented nature explained, and what's next for the record hurricane</a></p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Carnival Horizon, originally scheduled to make port at Grand Cayman in the Cayman Islands on July 3, canceled the visit. Its scheduled trip to Cozumel, Mexico, on July 4 was also replaced with a visit to Nassau in the Bahamas on July 5.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Carnival Liberty was moving its scheduled visit to Cozumel for July 5 to Tuesday as the cruise attempted to avoid the hurricane's forecasted path into the area.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"The safety of our guests and crew is paramount, and we are continuing to monitor forecasts and factor in guidance from the National Hurricane Center, U.S. Coast Guard and the local port authorities to provide timely updates to our guests as more information becomes available," said Carnival in a statement.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The Norwegian Cruise Line has also altered routes for two of their cruises, Norwegian Jade and Norwegian Breakaway, with canceled visits to Jamaica, Cayman Islands, Belize and Cozumel and Costa Maya in Mexico, both in the country's Yucatan Peninsula.</p><h2 class="RxNCg PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq">Trail of devastation</h2><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">As the storm barreled through the Caribbean Sea, rescue crews in southeastern islands fanned out to determine the extent of the damage Beryl inflicted on Carriacou, an island in Grenada.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Three people were reported killed in Grenada and Carriacou and another in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, officials said. Two other deaths were reported in northern Venezuela, where five people are missing, officials said. Some 25,000 people in that area also were affected by heavy rainfall from Beryl.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">One fatality in Grenada occurred after a tree fell on a house, Kerryne James, the environment minister, told The Associated Press.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">She said Carriacou and Petit Martinique sustained the greatest damage, with scores of homes and businesses flattened in Carriacou.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"The situation is grim," Grenadian Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell told a news conference Tuesday. "There is no power, and there is almost complete destruction of homes and buildings on the island. The roads are not passable, and in many instances they are cut off because of the large quantity of debris strewn all over the streets."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Mitchell added: "The possibility that there may be more fatalities remains a grim reality as movement is still highly restricted."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Meanwhile, Ralph Gonsalves, prime minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, promised to rebuild the archipelago in a statement early Tuesday. He noted that 90% of homes on Union Island were destroyed, and that "similar levels of devastation" were expected on the islands of Myreau and Canouan.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Several people evacuated Union Island via ferry and arrived at the Kingstown Ferry Terminal in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on Tuesday.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Sharon DeRoche, one of the evacuees, said Union Island is in a terrible state. She bore the hurricane in her bathroom before she fled. "It was a hard four hours battling with six of us in that little area," she said.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The last strong hurricane to hit the southeast Caribbean was Hurricane Ivan 20 years ago, which killed dozens of people in Grenada.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Grenadian resident Roy O'Neale, 77, lost his home to Ivan and built back stronger. His current home sustained minimal damage from Beryl.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"I felt the wind whistling, and then for about two hours straight, it was really, really terrifying at times," he said by phone. "Branches of trees were flying all over the place."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy"><strong class="vtkaO">RELATED:</strong><a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " href="https://6abc.com/post/hurricane-beryl-nj-family-vacationing-jamaica-stuck-island/15022496/" target="_blank"> Vacationing family from New Jersey stuck in Jamaica as Hurricane Beryl approaches</a></p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Hundreds of people hunkered in shelters across the southeast Caribbean, including 50 adults and 20 children who huddled inside a school in Grenada.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"Maybe some of them thought they could have survived in their homes, but when they realized the severity of it ... they came for cover," said Urban Mason, a retired teacher who served as the shelter's manager. "People tend to be complacent."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">One of the homes that Beryl damaged belongs to the parents of U.N. Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell, who is from Carriacou. The storm also destroyed the home of his late grandmother.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">In a statement, Stiell said that the climate crisis is worsening, faster than expected.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"Whether in my homeland of Carriacou ... hammered by Hurricane Beryl, or in the heatwaves and floods crippling communities in some of the world's largest economies, it's clear that the climate crisis is pushing disasters to record-breaking new levels of destruction," he said.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN">Grenada, known as the "spice isle," is one of the world's top exporters of nutmeg. Mitchell noted that the bulk of the spices are grown in the northern part of the island, which was hit hardest by Beryl.</p></div>
