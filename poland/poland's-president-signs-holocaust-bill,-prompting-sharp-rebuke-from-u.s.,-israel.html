<p>Polish President Andrzej Duda has signed a controversial Holocaust bill into law, triggering sharp criticism from the United States and Israel.</p>
<p>The measure signed on February 6 sets fines or a maximum three-year jail term for describing Nazi Germany's extermination camps in the country as "Polish death camps" or for suggesting "publicly and against the facts" that the Polish nation or state was complicit in the genocide committed by Nazi Germany during World War II.</p>
<p>Poland's right-wing government says the law is necessary to protect the reputation of Poles as victims of Nazi aggression.</p>
<p>"The United States is disappointed that the president of Poland has signed legislation that would impose criminal penalties for attributing Nazi crimes to the Polish state," U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a statement.</p>
<p>"Enactment of this law adversely affects freedom of speech and academic inquiry," Tillerson said.</p>
<p>Duda also said he would send the measure to the Constitutional Tribunal for clarifications on whether it conformed with laws on freedom of speech. Those are likely to be issued after the law goes into effect.</p>
<p>The legislation "preserves the interests of Poland, our dignity and the historical truth" and also "takes into account the sensitivity of those for whom the question of historical memory of the Holocaust remains exceptionally important," Duda said.</p>
<p>Officials from Israel's official Holocaust memorial have said it fears the law may distort history and impact Holocaust research, education, and remembrance.</p>
<p>The law's wording is flawed, and is "liable to result in the distortion of history due to the limitations that the law places on public expressions regarding the collaboration of parts of the Polish population... in crimes that took place on their own land during the Holocaust," Yad Vashem said in a statement.</p>
<p>On February 5, Israeli Education Minister Naftali Bennett said he would travel to Poland to discuss the bill. But a Polish government spokeswoman said Warsaw had canceled Bennet's visit.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said on February 1 that he was "deeply concerned" by the legislation.</p>
<p>Some historians say a nationalist paramilitary organization, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), committed atrocities during World War II, notably against Poles in Ukraine.</p>
<p>In Poland, UPA fighters are seen as death squads who were responsible for the ethnic cleansing of Poles from what is now western Ukraine.</p>
<p>In 2015, Ukraine's parliament gave recognition to those who served in the UPA as "Ukrainian independence fighters."</p>

<p>Moderate reformist Masud Pezeshkian, the winner of Iran's runoff presidential vote, has thanked young Iranians for helping him win as foreign leaders and members of the Iranian establishment congratulated him on his victory, while Washington dismissed the impact of the results.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian, a 69-year-old former heart surgeon, defeated ultraconservative hard-liner Saeed Jalili in the July 5 runoff, garnering 53.7 percent of the vote, or 16,384,403 votes, while Jalili received 44.3 percent, or 13,538,179 votes, according to results announced by Mohsen Eslami, the spokesman of Iran's election headquarters.</p> 
<p>"I am especially grateful to the dedicated and capable young people who came to work lovingly and sincerely on my team and together with the rest of the people shone a ray of hope and confidence in the future," the 69-year-old former heart surgeon <strong><a class="wsw__a" href="https://x.com/drpezeshkian/status/1809486104560640501" target="_blank">wrote on X</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian's victory came amid a turnout of 49.8 percent, considerably higher than the record-low 40 percent in the first round of the election, which was triggered by the death of President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash in May.</p>
<p>Social media videos purported to show Pezeshkian's supporters, mostly young people, taking to the streets of Tehran and other Iranian cities to celebrate, even before the final results were announced.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian, however, warned that a "difficult path" lies ahead for the Islamic republic and appealed to Iranians not to leave him "alone" as he begins his presidency in a country beset by economic hardships compounded by international sanctions and dominated by a repressive theocracy.</p>
<p>"The difficult path ahead will only become smoother with your companionship, empathy, and trust. I extend my hand to you, and I swear on my honor that I, in turn, will not leave you alone on this path," Pezeshkian wrote in a separate message.</p>
<p>Voting on July 5 had been scheduled to end at 6 p.m., but it was extended three times until midnight as authorities sought to encourage as many people as possible to go to the polls.</p> 
<p>The first round failed to generate widespread participation, despite calls by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who wields ultimate power in Iran, for a high turnout to project an image of a strong Iran where its people back the political establishment.</p>
<p>Khamenei, who has final say in Iran's politics, congratulated Pezeshkian, calling for unity.</p>
<p>"I call on everyone to work together," said Khamenei, who had called the runoff vote "very important."</p>
<p>Hossein Salami, the chief of Iran's powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), also welcomed Pezeshkian's victory, offering his "cooperation" to the incoming president.</p>
<p>"We are fully prepared to continue and strengthen the cooperation and interaction between the IRGC and the government," Salami said in a statement.</p>
<p>Iran's theocracy, installed after the Islamic revolution of 1979, has long maintained that it derives its legitimacy from strong popular support that translates into high voter turnout, but poor participation in recent elections and deadly antiestablishment protests have challenged the legitimacy of the current leadership.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian has been a member of parliament since 2008 and served as deputy speaker between 2016 and 2020, when moderates and reformists had a majority in the legislature.</p> 
 
<p>Pezeshkian questioned Iran's methods of enforcing the Islamic head scarf for women following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in 2022 while in the custody of Iran's dreaded morality police for allegedly wearing her hijab improperly.</p>
<p>After Amini's death, which sparked months of unrest across the country, Pezeshkian demanded clarification from authorities about her case.</p>
<p>After casting his vote during the first round last week, Pezeshkian said, "We will respect the hijab law, but there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behavior toward women."</p>
<p>Pezeshkian has also spoken in favor of negotiating with the West, but he also supports the principles of the Islamic republic and said he would follow Khamenei's policies if elected.</p>
<p>While Pezeshkian's victory is unlikely to result in major policy shifts, it could have an impact on the succession to the 85-year-old Khamenei, who has been Iran's supreme leader since 1989.</p>
<p>Khamenei now has to give his approval to Pezeshkian's win in a ceremony known as "tanfiz."</p>
<p>Following that ceremonial step, the new president's inauguration is expected to take place sometime between July 22 and August 5.</p> 
<p>Pezeshkian, who finished the first round with 10.5 million votes -- 1 million more than Jalili -- appears to have been the one who benefited from the larger turnout in the second round, finishing the runoff with nearly 3 million votes more than his opponent.<br>
<br>
His campaign had sought to increase turnout by convincing people who boycotted the first round to vote in the runoff.</p>
<p>Mohammad Mohammad-Rezaei, a former lawmaker from Iran's Kurdistan Province who worked for Pezeshkian's campaign, told RFE/RL's Radio Farda that Pezeshkian's main advantage has been his galvanizing power among all walks of life.</p>
<p>"One of the merits of Pezeshkian is that he is a patriot and his character transcends party politics. He is above political parties, fronts, and groups," Mohammad-Rezaei said.</p>
<p>His supporters attempted to highlight what they saw as the dangers of a hard-line figure like Jalili coming to power, arguing that his administration would enact repressive policies and further isolate Iran.</p>
<p>Jalili's supporters portrayed Pezeshkian as a man who is soft on the West and who would make Iranian progress dependent on good relations with Western nations.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department, in comments to RFE/RL's Radio Farda, noted the results but said that elections in Iran are neither free or fair.</p>
<p>"As a result, a significant number of Iranians chose not to participate at all," a spokesman said. "We have no expectation these elections will lead to fundamental change in Iran&#8217;s direction or more respect for the human rights of its citizens. As the candidates themselves have said, Iranian policy is set by the supreme leader.</p>
<p>"The election will not have a significant impact on [Washington's] approach to Iran either. Our concerns about Iran&#8217;s behavior are unchanged. At the same time, we remain committed to diplomacy when it advances American interests."</p> 
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping both congratulated Pezeshkian on his victory.</p>
<p>"I hope that your tenure as president will contribute to a reinforcement of constructive bilateral cooperation between our friendly peoples," Putin said.</p>
<p>Russia and Iran, both under harsh Western sanctions, can "coordinate efforts to resolve international issues in a constructive manner," Putin added.</p>
<p>Iran has been supplying Russia with drones that Moscow has been using to attack mainly civilian targets in Ukraine since the Kremlin started the invasion of its neighbor in February 2022.</p>
<p>"I attach great importance to the development of China-Iran relations and am willing to work with the president to lead the China-Iran comprehensive strategic partnership towards deeper advancement," state news agency Xinhua quoted Xi as saying.</p>
<p>China is Iran's largest trade partner and a main destination for Tehran's sanctioned oil.</p>
<p>King Salman of Saudi Arabia, Iran's regional rival, in a message to Pezeshkian, expressed hope for the "continued development of relations which link our two countries and our two brotherly peoples," according to the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA).</p>
<p>The powerful Saudi crown prince also congratulated Pezeshkian on his election.</p>
<p>"I affirm my keenness on developing and deepening the relations between our countries and people and serve our mutual interests," SPA quoted Muhammad Bin Salman as saying.</p>
<p>Last year, Saudi Arabia and Iran agreed in a China-brokered deal to restore diplomatic ties after years on interruption.</p>
<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also congratulated Pezeshkian.</p>
<p>"Looking forward to working closely with you to further strengthen our warm and long-standing bilateral relationship for the benefit of our peoples and the region," Modi <strong><a class="wsw__a" href="https://x.com/narendramodi/status/1809520924095377577" target="_blank">wrote on X</a></strong>.</p>


<p>European leaders on July 5 slammed Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban for his visit to Russia to meet with President Vladimir Putin, accusing him of shaking hands "with a bloody dictator" and of "exploiting the EU presidency position to sow confusion."</p>
<p>Orban, who has angered EU and Ukrainian officials with his regular pro-Russia comments and policies, claimed he was in Moscow to help settle the war between Russia and Ukraine, but Western and Ukrainian officials have blasted the trip, insisting he doesn't speak for Brussels or Kyiv.</p>
<p>"In Moscow, Viktor Orban in no way represents the EU or the EU's positions," said Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, who has been designated to become the EU's next foreign affairs representative.</p>

<h3 class="wsw__h3">Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine</h3>
 
<p>RFE/RL's <strong><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-russia-crisis-crosshairs-live-briefing/31668477.html" target="_blank">Live Briefing</a> </strong>gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians.

<p>"He is exploiting the EU presidency position to sow confusion. The EU is united, clearly behind Ukraine and against Russian aggression,&#8221; she <strong><a class="wsw__a" href="https://x.com/kajakallas/status/1809173839072407554" target="_self">said</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda echoed her comments. The Baltic nations Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia have all expressed strong support of Ukraine following Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.</p>
<p>"If you truly seek peace, you don't shake hands with a bloody dictator, you put all your efforts to support Ukraine," Nauseda <strong><a class="wsw__a" href="https://x.com/GitanasNauseda/status/1809167663584747629" target="_self">wrote on X</a></strong>.</p>
<p>The White House joined in on the criticism, with press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre saying the visit "will not advance the cause of peace and is counterproductive to promoting Ukraine's sovereignty, territorial integrity, and independence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Following his talks with Putin at the Kremlin, Orban told a news conference that his trip represented a "first step to restore dialogue" between the warring parties, but he acknowledged that viewpoints remain "far apart" in Kyiv and Moscow.</p>
<p>"I have found that positions are far apart. The number of steps needed to end the war and bring about peace are many," said Orban, who vowed to "continue this work."</p>
<p>EU and Ukrainian officials have insisted that Orban, who holds the rotating EU Council presidency, has no authority to negotiate on behalf of the bloc or Kyiv.</p>
<p>In televised comments, Putin maintained his long-standing position -- which has been rejected by Kyiv -- telling Orban that Ukraine must hand over all of four regions in eastern and southern Ukraine that Russia has partially occupied and claimed as its own in their entirety.</p>
<p>"We are talking about the full withdrawal of all troops from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics [officially Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions], and from the Zaporizhzhya and Kherson regions," Putin said.</p>
<p>Russia state media said Orban departed Moscow late on July 5 on the planned one-day visit just ahead of a massive rainstorm.</p>
<p>Since word leaked a day earlier of the apparently uncoordinated visit, multiple senior EU officials intensified statements distancing the bloc from Orban's plans and actions, and Kyiv said it hadn't given its "agreement" to anything.</p>
<p>The trip comes less than a week after Budapest assumed the six-month rotating EU Council presidency and three days after Orban presented a mystery cease-fire proposal in another surprise visit to Kyiv.</p>
<p>Orban maintains close relations with Putin and has resisted EU and other sanctions on Russia and refused to join military and other Western aid efforts to help Ukraine beat back the 28-month full-scale invasion ordered by Putin.</p>
<p>Receiving Orban in the Kremlin, Putin said at the start of televised talks that he regarded the Hungarian leader as somehow acting on behalf of the European Union in terms that appeared crafted to troll Brussels.</p>
<p>"I understand that this time you have come not just as our longstanding partner but as president of the [EU] Council," Putin told Orban. He said he expected Orban to lay out "the position of European partners" on the situation in Ukraine and was ready to talk about "nuances" of peace proposals.</p>
<p>Orban is being accompanied on the trip by his foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto.</p>
<p>Orban's spokesman shared <strong><a class="wsw__a" href="https://x.com/PM_ViktorOrban/status/1809163540256698510" target="_blank">an image</a></strong> on social media of Orban on a red carpet on a tarmac in Moscow with the message "The #peace mission continues. Second stop: #Moscow."</p>
<p>Szijjarto <strong><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.facebook.com/szijjarto.peter.official/posts/1005915614335065" target="_blank">posted an image</a></strong> of himself exiting a Hungarian Air Force plane and said, "Arriving in Moscow. Another step for peace!"</p> 
<p>EU officials might disagree.<br>
<br>
An unnamed EU official told RFE/RL that Orban had not informed Brussels of any planned Moscow trip, and his press office did not initially respond to request for comment.<br>
<br>
Current EU foreign affairs high representative Josep Borrell <strong><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/russia-statement-high-representative-visit-prime-minister-orb%C3%A1n-moscow_en" target="_blank">said</a></strong> in a statement on July 5 that "Prime Minister Orban has not received any mandate from the EU Council to visit Moscow."</p>
<p>He said the visit "takes place, exclusively, in the framework of the bilateral relations between Hungary and Russia."<br>
<br>
Orban has whipped up heightened fears of an escalating conflict in recent Hungarian elections, seemingly adopted Kremlin talking points, and accused many in the West of warmongering in response to Russia's invasion.<br>
<br>
He has also whipped up heightened fears of an escalating conflict in recent Hungarian elections.<br>
<br>
Orban's record with respect to Moscow has sparked concerns that beyond rule-of-law and democracy disputes with Brussels, the Hungarian EU presidency might erode unity among bloc members in the face of Russian aggression.<br>

In Kyiv on July 2, Orban presented Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy with a cease-fire proposal he said was aimed at pausing the fighting. He declined to give details but said he asked Zelenskiy "whether it was possible to take a break, to stop the firing, and then continue the negotiations."</p> 
<p>Zelenskiy did not express his opinion on the proposal during the briefing with reporters, but a spokesman for the president said later on July 2 that Zelenskiy gave Orban an opportunity to air his thoughts.</p>
<p>Zelenskiy said after Orban's arrival in Moscow that the visit was "without agreement" of any kind from Kyiv.</p>
<p>Putin, who has denied Ukrainian nationhood and history, has said conditions for ending the war, which has killed and wounded more than 500,000 people on both sides, include Kyiv renouncing any NATO hopes and ceding Crimea and four other occupied regions of Ukraine.<br>
<br>
Zelenskiy has insisted its territorial integrity -- backed in multiple UN votes and a Ukrainian-initiated Global Peace Summit in Switzerland last month -- must be the foundation of any peace deal.<br>
<br>
After word leaked on July 4 of Orban's planned visit, European Council President Charles Michel said "the EU rotating presidency has no mandate to engage with Russia on behalf of the EU."<br>
<br>
"The European Council is clear: Russia is the aggressor, Ukraine is the victim. No discussions about Ukraine can take place without Ukraine," Michel added.<br>
<br>
Orban last visited Moscow in September 2022, when he paid his respects at the funeral of former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.</p>

<p>A Bosnian man arrested in connection with the audacious escape of Russian businessman Artyom Uss from Italian arrest has been released and is now cooperating with Italian investigators.</p>
<p>U.S. prosecutors, meanwhile, have for now dropped their extradition request against the man, Vladimir Jovancic, who also faces a U.S. indictment for aiding Uss's March 2023 escape.</p>
<p>Jovancic's release from Croatian detention, and the halt to U.S. extradition proceedings, neither of which has been reported previously, are <strong><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.rferl.org/a/artyom-uss-escape-arrest-italy-russia-balkans-ukraine-invasion/32899209.html">small but significant developments</a></strong> in the continuing investigation of how Uss -- the politically connected son of a powerful Russian governor -- managed to slip out of Italy on the eve of his extradition to the United States.</p>
<p>Uss had been arrested by Italy after being charged by the U.S. Justice Department with overseeing an elaborate smuggling network that had secretly shipped Western military technology to Russia -- some of which had ended up on Ukrainian battlefields.</p> 
<p>His escape embarrassed Italian authorities and prompted criticism from Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who said there had been "<strong><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWcc1Szzqz4">anomalies</a></strong>" in the decisions that ultimately led to Uss's escape.</p>
<p>Jovancic, a 53-year-old national of Bosnia and Herzegovina, is one of eight people that Italian prosecutors have charged in connection with Uss's escape.</p>
<p><strong><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.rferl.org/a/us-reward-information-fugitive-russian-uss/32715734.html">He was arrested in December 2023</a></strong> in Zagreb after U.S. prosecutors secured a grand jury indictment of him in connection with the escape.</p>
<p>Since then, Jovancic has been cooperating with Italian prosecutors, providing testimony on at least two occasions.</p>
<p>Sometime late last month, however, Jovancic was released from Croatian detention and was extradited to Italy after reaching a plea agreement, his Croatian lawyer Gordan Preglej, told RFE/RL. The conditions of the deal require his cooperation with Italian officials and three years of community service, Preglej said.</p>
<p>His release also included the agreement by U.S. prosecutors to halt extradition proceedings.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York confirmed that Jovancic's extradition had been halted, but said the charges remain in place.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Milan prosecutors' office, which has been leading the Italian investigation, declined comment.</p> 
 
<p><strong>Where Is Uss?</strong></p>
<p>Uss, whose father was the governor of the sprawling Siberian region of Krasnoyarsk and an ally of President Vladimir Putin, slipped out of house arrest in a suburb of Milan on March 22, 2023, after disrupting the signal transmitted from a court-ordered electronic monitoring bracelet.</p>
<p>He and the people who aided him then drove east, across Slovenia, Croatia, and into Serbia. He later flew back to Krasnoyarsk.</p>
<p>Italian authorities have cast a wide net across Europe, trying to identify and arrest the people involved in the escape.</p>
<p>In addition to Jovancic, others who have been arrested or detained include his son, Boris, who is believed to be in Italian custody; and a Slovenian man arrested in Ljubljana.</p>
<p>The Ljubljana District Court told RFE/RL that that man, Matej Janezic, had been been released from custody, and extradited to Italy.</p>
<p>Italian officials have also charged an obscure Serbian businessman named Srdjan Lolic.</p>
<p>Roughly three weeks after he allegedly helped Uss flee Italy, <strong><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-arctic-uss-lolic-serb-polar-putin-ally-jailbreak/32996521.html">Lolic traveled to the North Pole</a></strong>, via Krasnoyarsk, accompanying a top Krasnoyarsk government official, and other Russian officials. Not known as a polar explorer, Lolic claimed to have been the first Serb to have reached the North Pole.</p>
<p>Lolic's whereabouts are currently unknown. But Italian court documents show he has provided written testimony to Italian prosecutors about the people who helped Uss escape.</p>
<p>Some of that testimony appears to have helped in the latest arrest <strong><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.rferl.org/a/italy-arrest-russian-uss-escape/32993139.html">announced</a></strong> by Italian officials on June 14: Dmitry Chirakadze, a Russian businessman who lives in Switzerland and controls a Sardinian hotel linked to Uss.</p>
<p>Chirakadze, who was arrested as he arrived at Rome's Fiumicino airport, has been fighting a court detention order, according to his defense lawyer.</p> 
<p>Italian authorities have also charged Uss's wife, Maria Yagodina, in connection with the plot.</p>
<p>Both she and Uss are believed in Russia, possibly Krasnoyarsk. In <strong><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.rbc.ru/politics/17/06/2024/6670537f9a7947fd7d0f0453">comments to Russian media</a></strong> following Chirakadze's arrest, Uss confirmed his business ties to Chirakadze and alleged the arrest was a "PR move" by Western officials.</p>
<p>The United States has offered a $7 million reward for information leading to Uss escape.</p>

<p>A triumphant Keir Starmer announced in London early on July 5 that "change begins now," after his Labour Party scored a landslide victory to end 14 years of Conservative government in the United Kingdom's general elections a day earlier.</p>
<p>But while new Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his center-left party have pledged a fresh approach to British economic woes and a cost-of-living crisis at home, they have signaled no dramatic break with the outgoing government's policy of robust military and diplomatic support for Ukraine in its ongoing war to defeat Russian invaders.</p>
<p>In a phone call with U.S. President Joe Biden hours after taking office, Starmer said U.K. backing for Ukraine's war effort would not be weakened under the new government. </p>
<p>"The leaders reiterated their steadfast commitment to Ukraine, and the prime minister underscored that the U.K.'s support for Ukraine was unwavering," Starmer's office said in a statement.</p>
<p>The two men "reiterated their continued support for Ukraine as it fights Russia&#8217;s unrelenting aggression," the White House <strong><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/07/05/readout-of-president-joe-bidens-call-with-prime-minister-keir-starmer-of-the-united-kingdom/" target="_blank">said</a></strong> in a separate readout.</p>
<p>While Labour has hinted at a more conciliatory tone than its Conservative predecessor in relations with the European Union, the party has gone to lengths to reassure NATO and other allies helping arm Kyiv that London will continue to regard Russia as a threat to Europe.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was quick to welcome the continuity in a message of thanks to the outgoing Conservatives and congratulations to the incoming Labour government for its "convincing election victory."</p>
<p>"Ukraine and the United Kingdom have been and will continue to be reliable allies through thick and thin," Zelenskiy <strong><a class="wsw__a" href="https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1809127702940516419" target="_blank">wrote on X</a></strong>. "We will continue to defend and advance our common values of life, freedom, and a rules-based international order."</p>
<p>He wished Starmer well in "solidifying the U.K.'s leadership on the world stage."</p>
<p>"I look forward to working closely together on strengthening the Ukraine-U.K. partnership and restoring international peace and security," Zelenskiy added.</p>
<p>"A mandate like this comes with a great responsibility," Starmer, who took over Labour's leadership four years ago, told supporters after the party's victory was assured.</p>
<p>At around noon local time at Buckingham Palace, King Charles III formally launched the 61-year-old former lawyer's tenure as prime minister by asking him to form a government.</p>
<p>Outgoing Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was a strong backer of NATO and other international assistance for Ukraine including the supply of weaponry.</p>
<p>Zelenskiy expressed gratitude in his message to Sunak and his government's "steadfast support" and "shared achievements," including the supplies of tanks, Storm Shadow missiles, F-16 training for our pilots, and the first bilateral security cooperation agreement" after Russia's invasion began.<br>
<br>
David Lammy, who was officially appointed on July 5 as foreign secretary in Starmer's Labour government, predicted Labour's return to power will usher in a foreign policy of "progressive realism."<br>
<br>
He has <strong><a class="wsw__a" href="https://x.com/DavidLammy/status/1809094960295166192" target="_blank">said</a> </strong>it is time to "turn the page on 14 years of Tory chaos."<br>
<br>
But the resets in foreign policy that Lammy has touted among Labour's goals involve reconnecting with Europe to repair some of the damage since Brexit, addressing climate change, and engaging more aggressively with the Global South.<br>
<br>
On defense, Starmer and Labour have described their commitment to NATO's foremost role in transatlantic security as "unshakable."<br>
<br>
On Ukraine, Labour has pledged "steadfast" military, financial, diplomatic, and political support. Labour's manifesto also calls for helping lay out a path for Ukraine toward NATO membership.</p>
<p>Olivia O'Sullivan, director of the U.K. In The World Program at Chatham House, a London-based think tank, told RFE/RL that "there are many ways in which the foreign policy positions of the Labour Party are not that distinct from the Conservatives," calling it "one surprising area of consensus in the U.K."</p>
<p>"Particularly on Ukraine, the Labour Party have been at pains to emphasize that they are as staunch and as consistent in their support for Ukraine," O'Sullivan said. "There's very little daylight between their position and [that of] the Conservatives."</p>
<p>The woman who is expected to assume the EU's top diplomatic post later this year, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, congratulated Starmer on his electoral victory and praised "the U.K.'s commitment to our common security."<br>
<br>
"I'm sure our excellent cooperation will only continue to thrive," <strong><a class="wsw__a" href="https://x.com/kajakallas/status/1809090457349103775" target="_blank">she added</a></strong> on X.<br>
<br>
Starmer has hinted that he would meet early in his leadership with Zelenskiy, and he has described Russian President Vladimir Putin as "the aggressor in Ukraine."<br>
<br>
"The most important thing is to be absolutely clear that our support for Ukraine is on a united front in this country," Starmer said.<br>
<br>
Starmer's new government will immediately have a chance to test that intention at NATO's 75th anniversary summit in Washington on July 9-11.</p>
<p>Soon after, Britain will host a European Political Community Summit at Blenheim Palace on July 18.</p>
<p>"I think one of their goals for both of those events...will be to affirm that they're taking a very similar line through the previous government on Ukraine and on support for Ukraine," O'Sullivan said.</p>
<p>She said Starmer's challenges include fiscal restrictions and looming elections in France and the United States, either of which could deal blows to transatlantic unity.</p>
<p>Analysts say British voters turned to Labour seeking relief from a 14-year Conservative tenure marked by the Brexit vote in 2016 to leave the European Union and economic woes and stagnation that have followed the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.<br>
<br>
Labour eclipsed the 326 seats needed for a working majority in the House of Commons early in the vote count that showed it gaining well over 200 seats as the Conservatives lost an even higher number of seats.<br>
<br>
Right-wing populist Reform Party leader Nigel Farage won a seat for the first time in eight attempts, indicating that Britain was experiencing some of the right-wing surge that showed up in last month's elections to the European Parliament.</p>


<p>Voting hours were extended three times before closing at midnight in Iran on July 5 in a runoff presidential election being held after no candidate secured enough votes to be declared the outright winner of the June 28 vote, which saw a record-low turnout</p>
<p>Polling stations were scheduled to close at 6 p.m. local time. However, voting was initially <strong><a class="wsw__a" href="https://twitter.com/RadioFarda_/status/1809292403708227969" target="_blank">extended</a></strong> to 8 p.m., then to 10 p.m., then a third time to midnight. Voting hours are often extended in Iranian elections.</p>
<p>At midnight, state TV said polling stations had officially closed but that voters inside would still be able to drop off ballots.</p>
<p>Initial results are likely to come out shortly after voting ends, with final results scheduled to be announced on July 6.</p>
<p>The election, which was triggered by the death of Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash in May, has come down to a choice between the reformist veteran lawmaker Masud Pezeshkian and hard-line former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili.</p>
<p>It comes at a time when Iranians are contending with a lack of freedoms, declining living standards, and a faltering economy.</p>

<p>Jalili serves as Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei&#8217;s personal representative on the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC). He was the SNSC&#8217;s secretary between 2007 and 2013, during which time he led the Iranian delegation in failed talks with the West on Tehran&#8217;s nuclear program.</p>
<p>He represents the hard-line part of the conservative camp and has never held elected office.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian has been a member of parliament since 2008 and served as deputy speaker between 2016 and 2020, when moderates and reformists had a majority in the legislature.</p>
<p>He has questioned Iran&#8217;s methods of enforcing the hijab, or Islamic head scarf, for women, and spoken in favor of negotiating with the West. But he also supports the principles of the Islamic republic and says he will follow Khamenei&#8217;s policies if elected.</p> 
<p>The outcome of the election is unlikely to result in major policy shifts, but it could have an impact on the succession to the 85-year-old Khamenei, who has been Iran&#8217;s supreme leader since 1989.</p>
<p>The first round of voting saw a record-low turnout of 39.9 percent, despite calls by Khamenei for a high voter participation to project an image of a strong Iran where its people back the political establishment.</p>
<p>Khamenei reiterated that message on July 3, when he acknowledged that first-round turnout was "not as expected" but denied the lack of voter interest reflected unpopularity for Iran's leadership.</p>
<p>He called the vote "very important," adding, "Those who love Islam and the Islamic republic and the progress of the country must show it by taking part in the election."</p> 
<p>Khamenei, who has the final say on all official matters in Iran, <strong><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.radiofarda.com/a/iran-presidential-election-runoff-jalili-pezeshkian/33022750.html" target="_blank">cast his vote </a></strong>at a mobile polling station at Imam Khomeini Hospital in Tehran in the first minutes after voting started on July 5.</p>
<p>"I've heard that people's enthusiasm and interest are higher than in the first round," Khamenei said. "May God make it this way as this will be gratifying news."</p>
<p>One man who asked not to be identified <strong><a class="wsw__a" href="https://twitter.com/RadioFarda_/status/1809216294127886681" target="_blank">told RFE/RL</a></strong> he did not participate in the first round of voting but that he cast a ballot for Pezeshkian in this round.</p>
<p>Sepideh, a 19-year-old university student in Tehran, told Reuters: "I will not vote. This is a big NO to the Islamic Republic because of Mahsa [Amini]. I want a free country, I want a free life."</p>
<p>The 2022 death in custody of Amini, a young Kurdish-Iranian woman, sparked massive street protests throughout Iran, leading to a brutal crackdown by authorities.</p>
<p>The Islamic republic has long maintained it derives its legitimacy from strong voter turnout, but poor participation in recent elections and deadly antiestablishment protests have challenged the legitimacy of the current leadership.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian finished the first round with 10.5 million votes, above Jalili&#8217;s 9.5 million. But he also benefited from the splitting of the conservative vote, with 3.4 million votes going to parliament speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf who has since endorsed Jalili.</p>
<p>However, there is no guarantee that all of Qalibaf&#8217;s votes will swing to Jalili since they represent vastly different groups in the highly factionalized conservative camp.</p> 
<p>Pezeshkian&#8217;s campaign has been trying to increase turnout by convincing people who boycotted the first round to vote in the runoff. His supporters have sought to highlight what they see as the dangers of a hard-line figure like Jalili coming to power, arguing that his administration will enact repressive policies and further isolate Iran.</p>
<p>Jalili's supporters have portrayed Pezeshkian as a man who is soft on the West and will make Iranian progress dependent on good relations with Western nations.</p>
<p>Dissidents have urged the public to continue their boycott of the vote, insisting that elections in Iran are neither free nor fair and that past votes have failed to instigate change since ultimate power lies with Khamenei.</p>
<p>Raisi, who many Iranians refer to as the "Butcher of Tehran" for his alleged role in the mass execution of political prisoners in 1988 when he was Tehran's deputy prosecutor, died along with Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and several other officials when their helicopter crashed on May 19.</p>


<p>Labor activist Sharifeh Mohammadi has been sentenced to death by the Revolutionary Court in the northern city of Rasht, <strong><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.radiofarda.com/a/sharifeh-mohammadi-death-sentence/33021607.html" target="_blank">rights groups told RFE/RL&#8217;s Radio Farda</a></strong> on July 4, a move her supporters have labeled "medieval and criminal."</p>
<p>The court said the woman been convicted on charges of "armed rebellion against the state" and included as evidence her membership in an independent labor organization.</p>
<p>She was also accused of being a member of the banned Komala Kurdish separatist party, which the family denied.</p>
<p>The Norway-based Hengaw and U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency also <strong><a class="wsw__a" href="https://hengaw.net/en/news/2024/07/article-13" target="_blank">reported on Mohammadi&#8217;s death sentence.</a></strong></p>
<p>The <strong><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.instagram.com/free_sharifeh_mohammadi/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=c6816ec8-de98-4ed1-809e-b85e0c52d762" target="_blank">Campaign for the Defense of Sharifeh Mohammadi </a></strong>described the labor organization -- the Coordination Committee for Helping to Establish Labor Organizations -- as legal but said that, in any case, she had not been a member for 10 years.</p>
<p>The Defense Campaign called the court verdict against her "medieval and criminal."</p>
<p>&#8220;Many believe that this ridiculous and baseless verdict was issued solely to create an atmosphere of fear and intimidation among Gilan [Province] activists,&#8221; the group said.</p>
<p>Mohammadi&#8217;s aunt, Vida Mohammadi, told RFE/RL's Radio Farda that the woman has been tortured in prison following her arrest on December 5, 2023, and that she had spent several months in solitary confinement.</p>
<p>Vida Mohammadi said Sharifeh Mohammadi was not affiliated with any political organization inside or outside the country.</p>
<p>The Hengaw rights watchdog said Mohammadi "endured mental and physical torture at the hands of Iranian Intelligence interrogators...who sought to extract a forced confession from her."</p>
<p>The U.S.-based Abdorrahman Boroumand Center, which focuses on Iranian issues, said the death sentence was linked to "her involvement with an independent labor union."</p>
<p>"This extreme ruling highlights the harsh crackdown on dissent within Iran, particularly against labor activists amid economic turmoil," it said.</p> 
<p>Major protests erupted in Gilan Province and throughout the country in 2022 following the death in police custody of <strong><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.rferl.org/a/police-assistant-dies-four-officers-injured-iran-protests/32044236.html" target="_blank">Mahsa Amini,</a></strong> a young Kurdish-Iranian woman who had been detained for allegedly flouting Iran's strict dress code for women.</p>
<p>More than 500 protesters were killed nationwide and thousands arrested during the months of unrest.</p>
<p>Domestic and International rights activists have accused Tehran of using the death penalty to intimidate protesters and others following the mass demonstrations.</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch (HRW) said Iran &#8220;<strong><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2024/country-chapters/iran" target="_blank">remains one of the world&#8217;s top practitioners</a></strong> of the death penalty, applying it to individuals convicted of crimes committed as children and under vague national security charges; occasionally, it is also used for nonviolent offenses.&#8221;</p>
