Indeed, the availability of electricity promotes the delivery of essential services such as education, health care, access to communication technologies, and increased agricultural and economic productivity. Nevertheless, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the proportion of Cameroon&#8217;s population with electricity access in 2021 was merely 65%<a title="Jacques Fotso, W., Mvogo, G. &amp; Bidiasse, H.

The Cameroonian government&#8217;s electrification projects have mostly resulted in the electrification of urban centers. Similarly, the towns served by the power grid face issues with reliability and stability. Power outages, load shedding, and voltage drops are common on the electrical grid, causing significant social and economic consequences for the population. In 2021, Cameroon&#8217;s power network experienced an average system interruption duration index (SAIDI) of 162.6&#160;h and an average system interruption frequency index (SAIFI) of 41.8<a title="Eneo-Annual-Review-2021.pdf.

Renewable energies, particularly solar photovoltaic energy, are critical for expanding the population&#8217;s access to electricity in a sustainable basis. PV systems produce decarbonized and environmentally friendly electricity, which helps fight global warming. Cameroon has significant solar photovoltaic (PV) potential across its territory. The annual mean solar radiation varies across the country, with the north receiving 5.8 kWh/m2 and the south receiving 4.9 kWh/m2 <a title="Muh, E., Amara, S. &amp; Tabet, F.

Utilizing this significant potential could allow for both large-scale energy production for grid-connected systems and smaller, stand-alone systems. However, solar energy is not a panacea for Cameroon&#8217;s lack of access to high-quality energy. Solar panel output is highly dependent on the erratic nature of both solar radiation and ambient temperature, which frequently leads to an imbalance between supply and demand. In order to mitigate this issue, storage systems are interconnected with photovoltaic systems to ensure the uninterrupted provision of energy to diverse loads in the event of solar panel failure. Furthermore, adding supplementary power sources, such as diesel generators, can improve the HRES&#8217;s reliability. The incorporation of diverse energy sources and storage systems into renewable energy systems significantly impacts the expenses associated with their installation, operation, and maintenance. So, to be appealing, these renewable energy systems must be optimally dimensioned in order to reduce the investment required for installation. This work developed an optimal sizing approach for a HRES composed of batteries, solar panels, and a diesel generator for a residential application in Buea, Cameroon&#8217;s southwest region. The system is intended to operate independently of the electrical grid.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec3">Related works</h3><p>The literature extensively discusses the optimal design of Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems (HRESs), which integrate various energy sources such as solar panels, wind turbines, diesel generators, biogas generators, and storage systems. These systems are designed to provide a reliable and sustainable energy supply by leveraging the complementary nature of different energy sources. For instance, solar panels generate electricity during the day, while wind turbines can produce power both day and night, depending on wind conditions. Diesel and biogas generators serve as backup power sources, ensuring a continuous energy supply even when renewable sources are insufficient.</p><p>Determining the appropriate size and configuration of these HRESs is a complex task that involves balancing cost, efficiency, and reliability.

Their application to HRES design helps in achieving balanced, efficient, and sustainable energy systems.</p><p>Based on insights gained from an extensive review of the current literature, this study reveals a key gap in solving the energy challenges faced by residential areas in Buea, Cameroon. Despite the abundance of renewable energy resources, the region continues to grapple with an unreliable and unstable electricity grid, leading to frequent power outages and hindered socio-economic development. Existing studies have highlighted the potential of Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems (HRES) to mitigate these issues by harnessing solar energy alongside other renewable sources.</p><p>However, the literature reveals a lack of comprehensive research focused on optimizing the design and configuration of HRES specifically tailored for the residential context in Buea. Existing studies often overlook the unique socio-economic and environmental dynamics of the region, thus failing to provide practical solutions that address the specific needs and constraints of local residents. Furthermore, the existing energy management strategies in Buea primarily rely on traditional fossil fuel-based generators as backup power sources, contributing to environmental degradation and exacerbating the region&#8217;s vulnerability to climate change impacts. There is a pressing need for innovative, sustainable alternatives that not only ensure reliable energy access but also minimize greenhouse gas emissions and promote resilience in the face of evolving environmental challenges.</p><p>Therefore, the research problem addressed in this study revolves around the formulation of an optimal HRES configuration that balances cost-effectiveness, reliability, and environmental sustainability. By integrating insights from the literature review with empirical data and advanced optimization techniques, this research aims to contribute a tailored solution to the energy challenges faced by residential communities in Buea. The study seeks to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation, thereby offering valuable insights for policymakers, energy planners, and stakeholders involved in sustainable development initiatives in the region.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec4">Objective of the study</h3><p>This study sought to figure out the optimal dimension of an autonomous PV/Battery/Diesel hybrid system for residential use in Buea, Cameroon, with the goal of enhancing the community&#8217;s access to dependable and quality energy.

By maintaining the LPSP results at 0.009% and aligning the nominal capacity of the diesel generator with the maximum load demand (8.066&#160;kW), a system with complete reliability (LPSP&#8201;=&#8201;0%) was achieved. Figure&#160;<a href="/articles/s41598-024-66582-0#Fig8">8</a> shows the relationship among diesel generator rated capacity, energy cost, and LPSP. This energy management strategy utilized a diesel generator as an energy backup system to minimize GHG emissions.</p><p>Increasing the rated capacity of the diesel generator in Fig.&#160;<a href="/articles/s41598-024-66582-0#Fig8">8</a> results in a higher COE and a decrease in the LPSP towards zero. At a diesel generator rated power output of 8.066&#160;kW, which represents the peak load demand, the LPSP dropped to zero and the energy cost was 0.1718 kWh. The findings of the study indicate that the diesel generator plays a significant role in enhancing the dependability of the hybrid system under investigation. A comprehensive examination of the outcomes acquired for LPSP&#8201;&lt;&#8201;1% and LPSP&#8201;=&#8201;0% was conducted. Figure&#160;<a href="/articles/s41598-024-66582-0#Fig9">9</a> illustrates the yearly amounts of energy generated/consumed by the PV, diesel, and battery systems.</p><p>When LPSP was 0%, the PV system produced 49.04 MWh annually. Of this, 16.92 MWh was surplus energy, 20.55 MWh was used for battery charging, and 11.57 MWh was directly supplied to the load by the solar panels through the inverter. The battery supplied 16.66 MWh of energy to the load via the inverter annually, while the diesel generator produced 1.042 MWh of energy per year. The annual energy demand was 27.80 MWh. The diesel generator provides approximately 3.7% of the total annual energy demand.</p><p>When LPSP was 0.99%, the PV system produced 47.26 MWh annually. Of this, 15.2 MWh was surplus energy, 20.32 MWh was used to charge the batteries, and 11.70 MWh was directly supplied to the load via the inverter. The diesel generator produced 0.727 MWh of energy annually, while the battery supplied 16.52 MWh of energy to the load through the inverter. The diesel generator provided approximately 2.6% of the overall annual energy demand.</p><p>The annual generation of the diesel generator was minimal compared to the energy produced by the solar panels and batteries in the two LPSPs analyzed. The energy management strategy implemented in this study aimed to optimize the utilization of renewable energy sources instead of diesel. The diesel generators ran for 441&#160;h and consumed 241.96 L of diesel with LPSP&#8201;=&#8201;0.99%, whereas they ran for 348&#160;h and consumed 485.91 L of diesel with LPSP&#8201;=&#8201;0%.</p><p>Figures&#160;<a href="/articles/s41598-024-66582-0#Fig10">10</a> and <a href="/articles/s41598-024-66582-0#Fig11">11</a> show the energy production of the PV system, battery charging/discharging energy, and diesel generator for LPSP&#8201;=&#8201;0% and LPSP&#8201;=&#8201;0.99% over a 1-day period with minimal sunlight.</p><p>Figure&#160;<a href="/articles/s41598-024-66582-0#Fig10">10</a> illustrates that the diesel generator is utilized only when the storage system can no longer fulfill the demand in the LPSP&#8201;=&#8201;0% scenario. Given that the LPSP is 0%, the nominal capacity of the diesel generator is adequate to fulfill all demands, resulting in no energy deficit. Conversely, when the LPSP is 0.99% (LPSP&#8201;&lt;&#8201;1%), the nominal capacity of the diesel generator is significantly lower than demand. When the batteries can no longer meet the demand, an energy deficit occurs, as shown in Fig.&#160;<a href="/articles/s41598-024-66582-0#Fig11">11</a>.</p><p>Figure&#160;<a href="/articles/s41598-024-66582-0#Fig11">11</a> demonstrates that the diesel generator is utilized more when LPSP is 0.998% compared to when it is zero. In the 0.998% LPSP scenario, the diesel generator operated for a greater duration compared to the zero LPSP scenario.</p></div>
