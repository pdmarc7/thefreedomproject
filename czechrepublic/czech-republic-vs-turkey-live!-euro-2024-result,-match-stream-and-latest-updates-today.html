THAT WILL DO IT!

A good ball rolled back from the byline and he strikes it too high.</p><p>Orkan Kokcu on to reinforce the Turkish midfield, off goes Hakan Calhanoglu.</p><h2>Czech Republic 1-1 Turkey | 86 mins</h2><p>21:44</p><p>Samet Akaydin takes the next yellow card of the night for chopping a Czech runner at a counter.</p><p>That&#8217;s booking number 11 and a one-game ban should Turkey make it through.</p><p>Nothing comes from the free-kick, though.</p><h2>Czech Republic 1-1 Turkey | 84 mins</h2><p>21:43</p><p>Czech fury on the touchline as a throw-in decision goes against them.</p><p>Another booking or two for the substitutes.</p><h2>Czech Republic 1-1 Turkey | 81 mins</h2><p>21:39 , Marc Mayo</p><p>David Jurasek&#8217;s low cross draws a hasty clearance!</p><p>Czech pressure growing as Turkey fail to win a foul up the pitch.</p><p>Ondrej Lingr flicks a header off target and we have a booking for Mert Muldur.

Okay Yokuslu on for the booked Ismail Yuksek in midfield.</p><p>Decent ball in too and a header back across goal is hacked away.</p><h2>Czech Republic 0-1 Turkey | 61 mins</h2><p>21:19 , Marc Mayo</p><p>Turkey are sitting deep now, they know Czech Republic need TWO goals to go through now.</p><p>Against ten men, can they take advantage of the extra space in behind?</p><h2>Goal in Gelsenkirchen</h2><p>21:17 , Marc Mayo</p><p>And it&#8217;s 2-0 to Georgia over Portugal! A mega, mega shock on the cards.</p><h2>Watch Hakan Calhanoglu score for Turkey</h2><p>21:16 , Marc Mayo</p><p>You don&#8217;t save those.</p><h2>Czech Republic 0-1 Turkey | 56 mins</h2><p>21:15 , Marc Mayo</p><p>Triple Czech substitution.</p><p>Jindrich Stanek&#8217;s night is over with Adam Hlozek and Mojmir Chytil off. Chytil has done next to nothing in replacing Patrik Schick up top.</p><p>The new goalkeeper is Matej Kovar of Bayer Leverkusen. Jan Kuchta and big striker Tomas Cory are on.</p><h2>Czech Republic 0-1 Turkey | 54 mins</h2><p>21:12 , Marc Mayo</p><p>Jindrich Stanek is hurt before the kick-off, looks like a shoulder injury. Might have come in that mega save to deny Kenan Yildiz moments before the goal.</p><h2>GGGGGOOOOOAAALLLLL!!! Czech Republic 0-1 Turkey | Calhanoglu, 51'</h2><p>21:10</p><p>HAKAN CALHANOGLU SENDS TURKISH FANS WILD!</p><p>A great save from the Czech keeper but Turkey come again and their captain drills a shot low and into the far corner!</p><h2>Czech Republic 0-0 Turkey | 50 mins</h2><p>21:09</p><p>Ismail Yuksek booked to enable Czech Republic to enjoy some possession of their own.</p><p>We&#8217;re now onto six yellow cards (and one red)!</p><h2>Czech Republic 0-0 Turkey | 47 mins</h2><p>21:06 , Marc Mayo</p><p>Strong start from Turkey with two good balls in just evading their target.</p><p>Burak Yilmaz&#8217;s header across goal forced a touch from the keeper but no one was following in.</p><h2>Kick-off!</h2><p>21:04 , Marc Mayo</p><p>Time for the second half in Hamburg.</p><p>A Turkish change is afoot with Kaan Ayhan on for Salih Ozcan in midfield.</p><h2>Czech Republic have had their moments</h2><p>21:00 , Marc Mayo</p><p>A mammoth job on here for the Czechs after Antonin Barak&#8217;s red card for two soft bookings only 20 minutes in. That&#8217;s the earliest-ever red card in a European Championship game.</p><p>But they have looked threatening from set plays and continue to defend stoutly.</p><p>Chances will probably be at a premium however so misses like that one from David Jurasek late in the half could prove costly.</p><h2>Turkey not doing much with the ball</h2><p>20:56 , Marc Mayo</p><p>It&#8217;s so often the case isn&#8217;t it? Turkey have had 72 per cent of possession and zero shots on target.</p><p>Particularly since the red card, Czech Republic have sat deep with Turkey not possessing the final ball to unlock them. It&#8217;s largely been punts from range.</p><p>They&#8217;ll have plenty of time to push forward again in the second half, and at least they will know a draw will send them through.</p><p>But a Czech goal and Georgia win means it&#8217;d be curtains...</p><h2>How Group F stands at the break</h2><p>20:52 , Marc Mayo</p><p>Georgia&#8217;s one-goal lead over Portugal has them in third place as things stand and Turkey remain in the runners-up spot. Both are on four points with the Turks holding the better head-to-head record.</p><p>As for Czech Republic, they simply have to score - no matter what the result in the other game - and currently sit fourth.</p><h2>Half-time!</h2><p>20:48 , Marc Mayo</p><p>All square in Hamburg. A scrappy, tense half of football with Antonin Barak sent off for Czech Republic only 20 minutes in.</p><h2>Czech Republic 0-0 Turkey | 45 mins</h2><p>20:45 , Marc Mayo</p><p>CHANCE!</p><p>Lukas Provod leads Czech Republic forward on the break and David Jurasek overlaps on the left. Played in, he shoots and it&#8217;s well saved.</p><p>Mert Gunok stands up strong in the one-on-one.</p><p>Three added minutes.</p><h2>Czech Republic 0-0 Turkey | 43 mins</h2><p>20:43 , Marc Mayo</p><p>Hakan Calhanoglu winds up for a trademark strike from range and lofts it over the bar.</p><h2>Czech Republic 0-0 Turkey | 39 mins</h2><p>20:39 , Marc Mayo</p><p>A little bit &#8216;blood and thunder&#8217; here but both teams&#8217; ire is aimed at the referee.</p><p>Vladimir Coufal is down holding his head after taking an accidental elbow in the air from Kenan Yildiz. Istvan Kovacs doesn&#8217;t exactly rush to call on the physio.</p><h2>Czech Republic 0-0 Turkey | 38 mins</h2><p>20:37 , Marc Mayo</p><p>Now it&#8217;s Kenan Yildiz in the book! The Turkish attacker twisted his way into the box before running into touch and it looks like he landed a painful one on Robin Hranac as it went out.</p><p>The threshold for cards is low tonight...</p><h2>Czech Republic 0-0 Turkey | 36 mins</h2><p>20:36 , Marc Mayo</p><p>A stoppage with a Czech player on the turf and needing treatment, it&#8217;s Lukas Provod.</p><p>And we have another yellow card this time flashed at the bench. It looks like injured striker Patrik Schick has been punished for dissent - and that would be a one-game ban if they qualify for the next round (and he&#8217;s fit)!</p><h2>Czech Republic 0-0 Turkey | 33 mins</h2><p>20:33 , Marc Mayo</p><p>A succession of Turkish corners as their pressure builds. Nothing comes of it though after a lofted pass into touch.</p><h2>Czech Republic 0-0 Turkey | 31 mins</h2><p>20:31 , Marc Mayo</p><p>Yellow card for Salih Ozcan after grappling an opponent to the ground, halting a potential counter-attack.</p><h2>Watch Antonin Barak's red card</h2><p>20:28 , Marc Mayo</p><p>Professional opinion: it&#8217;s harsh.</p><h2>Czech Republic 0-0 Turkey | 28 mins</h2><p>20:28 , Marc Mayo</p><p>Every Czech player is behind the ball as Turkey set up camp on the edge of their final third.</p><p>A couple of probing balls see shots blocked at the last! Good work by Ladislav Krejci to deny Arda Guler.</p><p>Samet Akaydin flicks a header from the corner off target.</p><h2>Czech Republic 0-0 Turkey | 24 mins</h2><p>20:23 , Marc Mayo</p><p>Czech Republic were operating a 3-5-2 with wing-backs and that will drop to a 5-3-1 off the ball, and on it Adam Hlozek and the two wide players will have to work hard to get forward.</p><p>They have another free-kick into the box but a goal kick is the result after a bit of a scramble.</p><h2>Czech Republic 0-0 Turkey | 21 mins</h2><p>20:21 , Marc Mayo</p><p>Well what a disaster for Czech Republic. Two pretty harsh bookings in the space of nine minutes and Antonin Barak walks.</p><p>Romanian referee Istvan Kovacs won&#8217;t be getting many Christmas cards from Prague this year...</p><h2>Red card!</h2><p>20:20 , Marc Mayo</p><p>Antonin Barak is dismissed for a second yellow card!</p><h2>Czech Republic 0-0 Turkey | 17 mins</h2><p>20:17 , Marc Mayo</p><p>Half a chance from another Czech long throw, Tomas Soucek gets the flick on but Robin Hranac is underneath it and heads over.</p><p>Turkey are really struggling from set plays.</p><h2>Czech Republic 0-0 Turkey | 16 mins</h2><p>20:15 , Marc Mayo</p><p>Beautiful strike from David Jurasek as a Czech set-piece is cleared. From all of 35 yards, he strikes it so cleanly and it&#8217;s on target but right at the keeper.</p><p>Moments later and they come forward again, with a decent cross that evades Adam Hlozek. A decent connection would have really tested the keeper.</p><h2>Czech Republic 0-0 Turkey | 14 mins</h2><p>20:13 , Marc Mayo</p><p>Arda Guler races down the centre of the pitch and has options as defenders begin to catch up... he shoots from 25 yards and it flies over.</p><h2>Czech Republic 0-0 Turkey | 12 mins</h2><p>20:12 , Marc Mayo</p><p>Antonin Barak throws the ball down in disgust at a booking for dragging back Turkey full-back Ferdi Kadioglu, who we are obliged by media law to mention as an &#8216;Arsenal target&#8217; now the transfer window is open.</p><h2>Czech Republic 0-0 Turkey | 10 mins</h2><p>20:09 , Marc Mayo</p><p>An enjoyable end-to-end first ten minutes but Turkey are beginning to get the better foot on the ball.</p><p>Czech Republic won&#8217;t mind sitting in a little bit and pouncing on the counter.</p><h2>Czech Republic 0-0 Turkey | 6 mins</h2><p>20:06 , Marc Mayo</p><p>Anticipation emanates off the Turkish section of the ground, which is most of it to be fair, as Arda Guler picks up possession 30 yards from goal.</p><p>Nothing doing though as the ball goes out via Hakan Calhanoglu.</p><h2>Early goal for Georgia!</h2><p>20:04 , Marc Mayo</p><p>Kvicha Kvaratskhelia have put Georgia ahead against Portugal!</p><p>That doesn&#8217;t matter too much to these teams as a draw isn&#8217;t enough for the Czechs and Turkey are still second as it stands.</p><h2>Czech Republic 0-0 Turkey | 3 mins</h2><p>20:03 , Marc Mayo</p><p>Mert Gunok called into action with a drive from distance by Lukas Provod. Decent start by Czech Republic.</p><h2>Czech Republic 0-0 Turkey | 2 mins</h2><p>20:01 , Marc Mayo</p><p>Turkey certainly have the bulk of the support in Hamburg and Czech Republic pump a long throw into the box amid some heavy jeers.</p><p>A dangerous flick-on comes to nothing with a foul committed by the attacking side.</p><h2>Czech Republic vs Turkey | Kick-off!</h2><p>20:00 , Marc Mayo</p><p>It&#8217;s time to round off the Euro 2024 group stage!</p><p>Some memorable moments, certainly from Group F, already - let&#8217;s see if we can cap it off with some proper drama.</p><p>Turkey in all white, the Czechs in red and blue.</p><h2>Time for the national anthems</h2><p>19:56 , Marc Mayo</p><p>We begin with &#8216;Istiklal Marsi&#8217; from the Turks before Czech Republic anthem &#8216;Kde domov muj&#8217;.</p><h2>Here come the teams!</h2><p>19:53 , Marc Mayo</p><p>We have another full house in Hamburg and here come the two teams!</p><p>Romanian referee Istvan Kovacs, who took charge of the draw between Slovenia and Serbia earlier in the group stage, has the whistle.</p><h2>Road to Berlin</h2><p>19:48 , Marc Mayo</p><p>It&#8217;s worth saying that, should we have the fairly unlikely scenario of these teams finishing third in Group F and going through, they will take on Spain in Cologne on Sunday. Not easy...</p><h2>Who next for the Group F runners-up?</h2><p>19:46 , Marc Mayo</p><p>Finishing behind guaranteed group winners Portugal will mean a plum draw for either of these teams.</p><p>Austria have been good but not unbeatable and they await in the last-16, on July 2 in Leipzig.</p><p>Next up would be the winner between Romania and the third-placed team from either Group C or D - Slovenia or Netherlands.</p><p>The good thing for Turkey is that avoiding defeat tonight would bring Slovenia onto their path for a run deep into the Euros.</p><h2>How Czech Republic can qualify for the last-16</h2><p>19:41 , Marc Mayo</p><p>It is definitely very simple for Czech Republic tonight.</p><p>If they lose or draw, they are out. Even if it keeps them in third place, they will not have the points to be among the four best third-placed teams in that scenario.</p><p>Win and they are through, no ifs no buts - even if Georgia win too and leapfrog them to end up second.</p><h2>How Turkey can qualify for the last-16</h2><p>19:36 , Marc Mayo</p><p>It could be simple for Turkey tonight. But it might not be.</p><p>Win and they are through as group runners-up. Draw and they are through as group runners-up.</p><p>Lose and they will be kicked into fourth place and dumped out if Georgia also beat Portugal.</p><p>Lose and Georgia fail to win, they will qualify as a best third-placed team... so long as they only lose by two or fewer goals.</p><p>Such a scenario would see them have to avoid dropping below Hungary&#8217;s goal difference status, they hold two goals on them in goal difference and they have scored more goals. That means a three-goal defeat or worse sends them home no matter what happens in Georgia vs Portugal.</p><h2>Czech Republic vs Turkey | Countdown to kick-off</h2><p>19:30</p><p>We have just 30 minutes to go until kick-off in Hamburg.</p><p>And the fans are already bringing the noise and colour as the warm-ups begin!</p><h2>Turkey make six changes</h2><p>19:18 , Marc Mayo</p><p>Vincenzo Montella shuffles his pack.</p><p>Out go Zeki Celik and the suspended Abdulkerim Bardakci in defence with Kaan Ayhan dropped from the midfield for Salih Ozcan.</p><p>We also have an entirely new three-man frontline to support the striker, Burak Yilmaz.</p><p>Out go Yunus Akgun, Orkon Kocku and Muhammed Akturkoglu. In come Arda Guler, Ismail Yuksek and Kenan Yildiz.</p><h2>No Patrik Schick for Czech Republic</h2><p>19:13 , Marc Mayo</p><p>The Czechs are without their main man up front tonight as injury keeps Patrik Schick out of their line-up.</p><p>Two changes in total as Vaclav Cerny also drops out, in come Antonin Barak and Mojmir Chytil.</p><h2>Turkey starting line-up</h2><p>18:59 , Marc Mayo</p><p><strong>Turkey XI: </strong>Gunok; Muldur, Demiral, Akaydin, Kadioglu; Calhanoglu, Ozcan; Guler, Yuksek, Yildiz; Yilmaz</p><p><strong>Subs: </strong>Celik, Yokuslu, Kokcu, Akturkoglu, Tosun, Yazici, Bayindir, Kaplan, Kahveci, Ayhan, Cakir, Kilicsoy, Akgun, Yildirim</p><h2>Czech Republic starting line-up</h2><p>18:58 , Marc Mayo</p><p><strong>Czech Republic XI: </strong>Stanek; Holes, Hranac, Krejci, Coufal; Soucek, Provod, D. Jurasek; Barak, Hlozek, Chytil</p><p><strong>Subs:</strong> Zima, Vitik, Sevcik, Schick, Kuchta, Doudera, Kovar, Cerny, Chory, Lingr, Cerv, Jaros, Vlcek, Sulc, M. Jurasek</p><h2>Time for team news!</h2><p>18:57 , Marc Mayo</p><p>Right then, let&#8217;s get those all-important starting line-ups...</p><h2>How Czech Republic have fared so far</h2><p>18:46 , Marc Mayo</p><p>It has not gone to plan for the Czechs at all.</p><p>Having stunned Portugal by taking a second-half lead in their first game, they promptly scored an own goal before letting in an injury-time winner.</p><p>Against Georgia they were only a slightly bigger threat but snatched a point courtesy of Patrik Schick&#8217;s goal.</p><p>A much better display is essential here.</p><h2>How Turkey have fared so far</h2><p>18:40 , Marc Mayo</p><p>Not since 2008 have Turkey made it to the knockout rounds of the Euros and, if they manage it again this time, they have not done it the easy way.</p><p>A thrilling 3-1 win over Georgia to open the tournament, amid fights in the crowd in Dortmund, raised hopes that they would glide through a relatively easy group.</p><p>But they capitulated against Portugal, losing 3-0 to leave them a bit discombobulated. Which Turkey team turns up tonight will be decisive to the result.</p><h2>Head-to-head record</h2><p>18:33 , Marc Mayo</p><p>Turkey have won their last three meetings with the Czechs, most recently in a November 2022 friendly.</p><p>Czech Republic wins: 5</p><p>Turkey wins: 5</p><p>Draws: 1</p><h2>Vincenzo Montella calms Arda Guler debate</h2><p>18:25 , Marc Mayo</p><p>The absence of Arda Guler from Turkey&#8217;s starting line-up last time out was a precaution, not a tactical decision, Vincenzo Montella has assured.</p><p>There was surprise at the Real Madrid winger being dropped against Portugal but coach Montella has suggested Guler will be back tonight.</p><p>"Arda wasn't fit to play I can say clearly he could not play more than 30 minutes without increasing the risk,&#8221; he told reporters.</p><p>&#8220;So there was also a temptation of not putting him in 20 minutes from the end, but finally I gave in because good players must play my opinion.&#8221;</p><h2>Czech Republic admit major injury worry</h2><p>18:16 , Marc Mayo</p><p>Czech Republic may have to do without key striker Patrik Schick for their decisive last Euro 2024 Group E game against Turkey on Wednesday, coach Ivan Hasek said on the eve of the match.</p><p>The 28-year-old Schick, who was joint top scorer at Euro 2020, hobbled out of their last match against Georgia in Hamburg on Saturday with a calf injury and has not trained since.</p><p>&#8220;Patrik has been with the physios and doctors for the last two days,&#8221; Hasek told a press conference. &#8220;He wasn't training. He's getting better, but we will see tomorrow.</p><p>&#8220;Schick is a key player, one of the best scorers in Europe. But if he's not able to play, we need to replace him. And we have players who are able to replace him and they are ready and been working hard.&#8221;</p><p>Schick&#8217;s absence would be a serious blow to Czech hopes of progressing to the last 16. They lost to Portugal and were fortunate to avoid defeat by Georgia to earn a point. That means the Czechs must win on Wednesday.</p><p>&#8220;There is a positive energy in the team,&#8221; added Hasek.</p><p>&#8220;Some of the players have not played yet, not got that many opportunities and we want to win for them, mostly so that their chances of getting on the pitch and playing here remains.</p><p>&#8220;I really have great trust in my team, they play as one man and I think we will show that on the pitch.&#8221;</p><h2>Turkey shut out social media criticism</h2><p>18:08 , Marc Mayo</p><p>Turkey are turning a deaf ear to unhelpful social media criticism on the eve of their battle with the Czech Republic.</p><p>After a 3-1 opening win against Georgia, their subsequent 3-0 defeat to Portugal triggered criticism of coach Vincenzo Montella's tactics and some speculation of factions within the national team.</p><p>"Why do people want to cause an issue?" Montella said at a news conference in Hamburg where he was repeatedly asked about the criticism. "We are united. We won&#8217;t let that distract us. We are very motivated. Our fate is in our own hands.</p><p>"It's only our match that matters. We are focused on responding on the pitch as we have done over the past 10 months. [The players] need to be supported."</p><p>Winger Irfan Kahveci added: "What happens in social media, we just laugh at it because most of the time there&#8217;s nothing happening inside the team. We have a hard time understanding what&#8217;s happening on social media.</p><p>"Within the team, everything is good, we&#195;&#162;&#194;&#8364;&#194;&#8482;re not being impacted by what people say online. Quite on the contrary, we are energised ... Whether players are from Galatasaray, Besiktas, Trabzonspor or others, we're all very good friends. We are united under the national flag."</p><h2>Czech Republic vs Turkey | Countdown to kick-off</h2><p>17:59 , Marc Mayo</p><p>We are now two hours away from this group-stage finale getting underway in Hamburg.</p><p>Team news is due in about an hour but could come ahead of time.</p><p>Turkey fans in particular have been making themselves known on the way to the ground!</p><h2>Half-time in the early games</h2><p>17:49 , Marc Mayo</p><p>The 5pm kick-offs are now at half-time with Romania 1-1 against Slovakia and Ukraine 0-0 against Belgium.</p><p>As things stand, those teams are all on four points...</p><p>That probably isn&#8217;t preferable for Turkey as, in the event they rely on a third-placed finish, they could always do with another team on three points with a poor goal difference to go up against.</p><p>The Czechs will qualify with a win later on, no matter what happens in Group E.</p><h2>Score prediction</h2><p>17:41 , Marc Mayo</p><p>Both sides have looked shaky for much of this tournament which makes for a very difficult-to-predict finale, with so much on the line.</p><p>A 1-1 draw.</p><h2>Our prediction for the Turkey XI</h2><p>17:34 , Marc Mayo</p><p><strong>Predicted Turkey XI:</strong> Gunok; Muldur, Demiral, Ayhan, Kadioglu; Yuksek, Calhanoglu; Guler, Kokcu, Yildiz; Yilmaz</p><h2>Early Turkey team news</h2><p>17:25 , Marc Mayo</p><p>Merih Demiral could replace the suspended Abdulkerim Bardakci in the centre of the Turkish defence.</p><p>Real Madrid winger Arda Guler will hope for a recall with changes likely following their defeat to Portugal.</p><p>Guler was dropped to the bench against Portugal having scored a screamer in their opening game, but Turkey boss Vincenzo Montella confirmed after the game that the 19-year-old was struggling with an injury issue.</p><p>Turkey will hope to have him back in the starting line-up here, with Yunus Akgun likely the man to miss out if Guler does return.</p><p>Samet Akaydin, who scored a disastrous own goal in the defeat to Portugal, is a doubt, after he was forced off late in that match with an injury issue.</p><h2>How we expect Czech Republic to line up</h2><p>17:20 , Marc Mayo</p><p><strong>Predicted Czech Republic XI: </strong>Stanek; Holes, Hranac, Krejci; Coufal, Soucek, Provod, Doudera; Hlozek, Lingr, Chytil</p><h2>Early Czech Republic team news</h2><p>17:14 , Marc Mayo</p><p>The Czechs are sweating over an injury to Patrik Schick.</p><p>The striker scored his side&#8217;s equaliser against Georgia but pulled up in the second half and was forced to immediately come off.</p><p>Mojmir Chytil could be the one to lead the line in Schick&#8217;s absence.</p><p>Ondrej Lingr is also hoping to earn a first start of the tournament, while David Doudera and Antonin Barak are also options to come into the side should Ivan Hasek opt to make further changes.</p><h2>How to watch</h2><p>16:58 , Marc Mayo</p><p>TV channel:&#160;In the UK, the game will be televised live on ITV4, with coverage beginning at 7.15pm.</p><p>Live stream:&#160;Fans can also catch the contest live online for free via the ITVX app and website.</p><h2>Czech Republic vs Turkey LIVE!</h2><p>16:46 , Marc Mayo</p><p>Hello and welcome to <strong>Standard Sport</strong>&#8217;s live coverage of Czech Republic vs Turkey.</p><p>The Euro 2024 group stage wraps up tonight with Group F the last to finish off, where we find ourselves for this game.
