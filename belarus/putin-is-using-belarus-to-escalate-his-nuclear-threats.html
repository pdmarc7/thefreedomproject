<p>Belarus engaged in a bout of nuclear saber-rattling on June 30, with Chief of the Belarusian General Staff Pavel Muraveiko declaring that his country would not hesitate to use nuclear weapons if provoked. &#8220;We&#8217;ve learned how to handle these weapons. We know how to apply them confidently. And you can be sure that we will do it if the sovereignty and independence of our country is threatened,&#8221; Muraveiko <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/belarus-nuclear-threat-ukraine-war-border-1919355">stated</a>.</p>



<p>The Belarusian army commander&#8217;s hawkish comments came just weeks after Belarus and Russia conducted <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-belarus-nuclear-drills-ukraine-1a601fd9de0c32158278851cc153c2ce">joint nuclear drills</a> that were widely interpreted as an attempt to intimidate the West. This followed on from Vladimir Putin&#8217;s spring 2023 announcement of plans to store Russian tactical nukes on Belarusian territory. By the end of the year, the weapons had <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/russia-completes-nuclear-weapons-shipments-to-belarus-president-says-13037581">reportedly</a> arrived in Belarus.</p>



<p>Muraveiko&#8217;s recent statement illustrates how the Kremlin is using Belarus to escalate its campaign of nuclear blackmail against the West. Clearly, any Russian nuclear weapons deployed across the border in Belarus remain firmly under Moscow&#8217;s control. If Belarusian officials are now issuing nuclear threats of their own, they are doing so on behalf of Putin.</p>



<p>This is very much in line with the supporting role played by Belarus throughout Russia&#8217;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. When hostilities first began in February 2022, Belarusian dictator Alyaksandr Lukashenka allowed the Russian military to use his country as a base for the invasion of northern Ukraine. Following Russia&#8217;s spring 2022 defeat in the Battle of Kyiv, Putin&#8217;s army then retreated back into Belarus to regroup.</p>



<p>While Lukashenka has so far been able to resist Kremlin pressure to enter the war directly, he has allowed Russia to conduct air strikes on targets across Ukraine from Belarusian territory. He has also been one of the few international leaders prepared to publicly align himself with Putin, meeting with the Russian dictator on multiple occasions.</p>



<p>Lukashenka&#8217;s slavish loyalty to his Russian patron comes as no surprise. The Belarusian ruler has been heavily dependent on the Kremlin since 2020, when Putin intervened to prevent the Lukashenka regime from collapse amid nationwide protests over a rigged presidential election. For the past four years, Russia has been steadily strengthening its grip on Belarus, a process some have likened to the <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/russian-nukes-in-belarus-putins-creeping-annexation-continues/">creeping annexation</a> of the country. </p>

<p>With Russian influence in Belarus now at unprecedented levels, Lukashenka has had little choice but to back the invasion of Ukraine. Naturally, this support includes playing along with Putin&#8217;s nuclear intimidation tactics. Perhaps more surprising is Putin&#8217;s readiness to involve Russia&#8217;s small western neighbor in his incredibly reckless game of nuclear brinkmanship.</p>



<p>Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began almost two and a half years ago, Putin has become notorious for frequently issuing thinly-veiled nuclear threats. This trend was first evident during his initial address announcing the decision to invade, with Putin warning Western leaders that any attempts to intervene would lead to consequences &#8220;such as you have never seen in your entire history.&#8221; Four days later, he ordered Russia&#8217;s nuclear forces to be put on <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-business-europe-moscow-2e4e1cf784f22b6afbe5a2f936725550">high alert</a>.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/09/21/putin-calls-300000-reservists-partial-mobilisation/">infamous example</a> of Putin&#8217;s nuclear saber-rattling came six months later. With the Russian army retreating in disarray in eastern Ukraine, the Kremlin ruler referenced his country&#8217;s nuclear arsenal and vowed to use &#8220;all means at our disposal&#8221; to defend Russia. &#8220;This is not a bluff,&#8221; he declared.</p>



<p>With Western support for Ukraine regaining momentum in recent months, Putin has once again made regular references to a possible nuclear war. Western leaders &#8220;should keep in mind that theirs are small and densely populated countries,&#8221; he <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/putin-europe-face-serious-consequences-ukraine-strikes-russia-2024-5">commented</a> chillingly in late May.</p>



<p>Other Kremlin leaders have gone even further. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, who currently serves as deputy chair of Russia&#8217;s Security Council, recently stated that it would be a &#8220;fatal mistake&#8221; for Western leaders to believe Russia was not ready to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine or NATO member states. &#8220;This is, alas, not an attempt at intimidation or a nuclear bluff,&#8221; he <a href="https://t.me/medvedev_telegram/499">declared</a>. </p>



 



<p>While Ukraine has refused to be cowed by Russia&#8217;s repeated nuclear threats, many in the West have allowed themselves to be intimidated. Indeed, widespread alarm over the potential use of nuclear weapons is believed to be a key factor fueling the fear of escalation that has consistently hampered the international response to Russia&#8217;s invasion.</p>



<p>Putin is well aware of the low risk tolerance in many Western capitals and has used it to his advantage. He has skillfully exploited the West&#8217;s escalation phobia to reduce the flow of military aid to Kyiv, and has even managed to convince Ukraine&#8217;s partners to impose absurd restrictions on how the embattled country can defend itself.</p>



<p>Russia&#8217;s readiness to employ nuclear threats could have grave implications for international security that would be felt far beyond the battlefields of Ukraine. If nuclear blackmail enables Putin to succeed in Ukraine, he will inevitably use the same tactics again elsewhere. Other countries will then draw the logical conclusion and decide that they, too, must also possess nuclear weapons, sparking a scramble for nukes that will undo decades of nonproliferation efforts. The entire world will be plunged into an era of insecurity marked by a dramatically heightened risk of nuclear war.</p>



<p>If Western leaders wish to avoid this bleak future, they must finally stand up to Russia&#8217;s nuclear bullying. At this point, Putin evidently regards his nuclear bluster as an effective foreign policy tool. Far from being deterred, he appears determined to raise the stakes further by involving Belarus.</p>



<p>Putin will continue to pursue policies of nuclear intimidation until the costs outweigh the benefits. This can be achieved by increasing Western military support for Ukraine and lifting all remaining restrictions on Kyiv&#8217;s ability to strike back against Russia. Unless that happens, there is a very real danger that the international security climate of the coming decades will be defined by nuclear-backed expansionism and further wars of imperial aggression.</p>
