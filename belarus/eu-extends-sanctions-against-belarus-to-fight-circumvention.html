					<div><p>Following the adoption of its <a href="https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/insights/publications/2024/06/eu-adopts-14th-sanctions-package-against-russia">14th sanctions package against Russia</a>, the European Union ("<strong>EU</strong>") extended the scope of its sanctions against Belarus with a view to "mirroring several of the restrictive measures already in place against Russia"<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">1</a> and "making EU sanctions against Russia more effective".<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">2</a></p>
<p>The legal texts, published on June 30, 2024,<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">3</a>&#160; provide for significant amendments to Council Regulation (EC) No&#160;765/2006 ("<strong>Regulation 765/2006</strong>"),<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">4</a> to align part of the sanctions targeting Belarus with those applicable to Russia. Anti-circumvention tools applicable to Russia have been replicated for Belarus. This includes "No Belarus" contractual clause requirements, the introduction of best effort requirements vis-&#224;-vis non-EU subsidiaries and specific compliance measures relating to Common High Priority Items. In addition, both export-related and import-related restrictions have been aligned with those targeting Russia, resulting in a substantial increase in the scope of controlled items and transactions. Prohibitions were also introduced to target new investments in the energy sector in Belarus, while services and software restrictions were imposed against the Government of Belarus, its public bodies, corporations and agencies. Road transport prohibitions have also been aligned with those applicable against Russia. At the same time, facilitations were introduced regarding the release of goods presented to customs before sanctions became applicable, to facilitate divestments from Belarus and to permit the recovery of damages caused by claims lodged outside the EU to force the execution of contracts or transactions affected by sanctions against Belarus. The list of partner countries has also been updated to mirror the one established under the Russian sanctions regime. Mirroring, again, the Russian sanctions regime, provisions on enforcement were introduced, notably through reporting obligations and clarifications of the concept of circumvention.</p>
<p>These new sanctions against Belarus entered into force at midnight on July 1, 2024. </p>
<h4><strong>1. Extended Grounds for Listing and Derogation under Asset Freeze Measures</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>1.1 New grounds for listing under asset freeze measures</strong></h5>
<p>The Council is now empowered to impose asset freeze measures against natural persons ("<strong>individuals</strong>") or legal persons, entities or bodies ("<strong>entities</strong>"): </p>
<ul>
    <li>Facilitating infringements of the prohibition against circumvention of EU sanctions against Belarus or otherwise significantly frustrating those sanctions; </li>
    <li>Associated with individuals or entities designated as subject to asset freeze measures.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>1.2 Introduction of a derogation to authorize the implementation of ring-fencing mechanisms</strong></h5>
<p>National competent authorities ("<strong>NCA</strong>") can now authorize transactions which would otherwise be prohibited by asset freeze measures, where necessary for setting-up, certifying or evaluating a firewall, which seeks (i) to remove control by an asset freeze target over a non-listed entity it owns or controls and (ii) to ensure that no funds or economic resources accrue to the benefit of such asset freeze target.</p>
<h4><strong>2. Replicating Anti-Circumvention Tools Applicable Under Sanctions Targeting Russia</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>2.1 Introduction of "No Belarus" contractual clause requirements</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Scope of the "No Belarus" requirement </strong>&#8211; &#160;Like for Russia, "No Belarus" contractual clause requirements now apply in relation to the following goods and technologies:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Firearms, other arms and ammunitions, as listed in Annex XVI of Regulation 765/2006 and Annex I to Regulation (EU) 258/2012 ("<strong>Regulation 258/2012</strong>");</li>
    <li>Goods and technology suited for use in aviation or the space industry, as listed in Annex XVII of Regulation 765/2006;</li>
    <li>Jet fuel and fuel additives, as listed in a new Annex XXVIII of Regulation 765/2006;</li>
    <li>Common High Priority Items, as listed in a new Annex XXX of Regulation 765/2006.<br>
    (together, "<strong>Sensitive Items</strong>")</li>
</ul>
<p>Accordingly, exporters must, when selling, supplying, transferring or exporting Sensitive Items to a third-country, (i) contractually prohibit re-exportation to or for use in Belarus, (ii) provide for adequate remedies in case this contractual obligation is breached and (iii) inform their NCA as soon as they become aware of such breach.</p>
<p><strong>Exemptions </strong>&#8211; "No Belarus" contractual clause requirements do not apply to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The sale, supply, transfer or export to partner countries, as listed in Annex Vba of Regulation 765/2006;<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">5</a></li>
    <li>Contracts relating to goods falling under CN codes 8457 10, 8458 11, 8458 91, 8459 61, 8466 93;</li>
    <li>Contracts concluded before July 1, 2024, until their expiry date;</li>
    <li>Public contracts concluded with a public authority in a third country or with an international organization.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">6</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential extension to non-EU subsidiaries</strong> &#8211; Recitals clarify that the European Commission will monitor the situation to determine whether EU operators should require their non-EU subsidiaries to also use the "No Belarus" clause.</p>
<h4><strong>2.2 Introduction of best efforts requirements to ensure that non-EU subsidiaries do not undermine sanctions set forth in Regulation 765/2006 </strong></h4>
<p>Individuals or entities required to comply with EU sanctions ("<strong>EU operators</strong>") must undertake their best efforts to ensure that non-EU entities they own or control ("<strong>non-EU subsidiaries</strong>") do not participate in activities that undermine the sanctions set forth in Regulation 765/2006. </p>
<p>In line with similar requirements introduced in the context of the EU's 14th sanctions package against Russia,<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7">7</a> recitals clarify that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Activities that would undermine the sanctions set forth in Regulation 765/2006 are those resulting in an effect that this Regulation seeks to prevent;</li>
    <li>Best efforts comprise all actions that are suitable and necessary to prevent undermining Regulation 765/2006, but only actions that are feasible;</li>
    <li>However, requirements to ensure that non-EU subsidiaries prevent exports or re-exports to Belarus "should be pursued to the extent that is permitted by the legislation of the third country where the legal person, entity or body in question is established".</li>
</ul>
<h5>2.3 Specific compliance measures relating to Common High Priority Items</h5>
<p>EU operators selling, supplying, transferring or exporting Common High Priority Items, as listed in Annex XXX of Regulation 765/2006, must as of January 2, 2025:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Document and keep up-to-date risk assessments relating to the risks of exports to or for use in Belarus of Common High Priority Items, proportionate to their nature and size;</li>
    <li>Implement policies, controls and procedures to mitigate and manage risks of exports to or for use in Belarus, which have to be proportionate to the nature and size of the operator;</li>
    <li>Ensure that the aforementioned measures are implemented in non-EU subsidiaries that sell, supply, transfer or export Common High Priority Items, unless due to reasons the EU operator did not cause itself, it is not able to exercise control over the non-EU subsidiary.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above requirements do not apply to EU operators that sell, supply or transfer Common High Priority Items only within the EU or to partner countries.</p>
<h4>3. Aligning Export-Related Restrictions With Those Targeting Russia</h4>
<h5><strong>3.1 Clarification of brokering controls on military items </strong></h5>
<p>Regulation 765/2006 now expressly prohibits the provision, in addition to technical assistance, of brokering services related to items listed in the Common Military List of the EU to any individual or entity in Belarus or for use in Belarus.</p>
<p>This amendment reflects existing requirements contained in Council Decision 2012/642/CFSP, which already required Member States to take measures to prohibit the provision of brokering services related to arms and related material of all types to any individual or entity in Belarus or for use in Belarus.</p>
<h5><strong>3.2 Extension of controls on transit via Belarus</strong></h5>
<p>The transit via Belarus of the following items exported from the EU is now prohibited:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Dual-use goods, technology and software, as listed in Annex I of Regulation (EU) 2021/821 ("<strong>Dual-Use Regulation</strong>");</li>
    <li>Goods and technology which might contribute to Belarus&#8217;s military and technological enhancement, or to the development of its defence and security sector ("<strong>advanced technology items</strong>"), as listed in Annex Va of Regulation 765/2006;</li>
    <li>Firearms, their parts and essential components and ammunition, as listed in Annex XVI of Regulation 765/2006 and Annex I of Regulation 258/2012;</li>
    <li>Machineries, as listed in a new Annex XIVa of Regulation 765/2006;<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8">8</a></li>
    <li>Goods and technology suited for use in aviation or the space industry, as listed in Annex XVII of Regulation 765/2006.</li>
</ul>
<p>Limited exemptions and/or derogations may be available, in line with those applicable for existing export controls.</p>
<h5><strong>3.3 Extension of controls to intellectual property rights and trade secrets</strong></h5>
<p>The sale, licensing and transfer of intellectual property rights ("<strong>IPR</strong>") or trade secrets, as well as granting rights to access or re-use any material or information protected by means of IPR or constituting trade secrets ("<strong>IPR and trade secrets provision</strong>") to any individual or entity in Belarus or for use in Belarus is prohibited in relation to the following items and to their provision, manufacture, maintenance and use:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Dual-use goods, technology and software, as listed in Annex I of the Dual-Use Regulation;</li>
    <li>Advanced technology items, as listed in Annex Va of Regulation 765/2006;</li>
    <li>Firearms, their parts and essential components and ammunition, as listed in Annex XVI of Regulation 765/2006 and Annex I of Regulation 258/2012;</li>
    <li>Goods and technology suited for use in aviation or the space industry, as listed in Annex XVII of Regulation 765/2006.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>3.4 Dual-use and advanced technology items (Annex I of the Dual-Use Regulation &amp; Annex Va of Regulation 765/2006)</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Extended list of advanced technology items </strong>&#8211; Annex Va of Regulation 765/2006 has been revised to be aligned with Annex XXIII of Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 ("<strong>Regulation 833/2014</strong>"), providing for similar restrictions in relation to Russia. </p>
<p><strong>New derogation for advanced technology items</strong> &#8211; NCAs may authorize certain transactions related to the fulfilment of maintenance obligations by Member States in areas under long-term lease agreements with Belarus.</p>
<p><strong>Increased information sharing</strong> &#8211; Member States are required to exchange information on the application of export-related restrictions on dual-use and advanced technology items. This includes information on authorizations granted and denied, but also on requests for authorization received in the event of suspected forum shopping or other cases as appropriate. In addition, information on enforcement, infringement, penalties, best practices for national enforcement and detection and prosecution of unauthorized exports must be shared.</p>
<h5><strong>3.5 Machineries (Annex XIV of Regulation 765/2006)</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Updated list of machineries</strong> &#8211; Annex XIV already covered all products that were classified under heading 8539 of the EU's Combined Nomenclature ("<strong>CN</strong>"). The description of this heading has been aligned with the description of the CN to clarify that this covers "light-emitting diode (LED) light sources" and "parts thereof", in addition to "electric filament or discharge lamps, including sealed beam lamp units and ultraviolet or infra-red lamps; arc lamps; parts thereof".</p>
<p><strong>New derogation</strong> &#8211; NCAs may authorize transactions involving machineries intended for certain diplomatic representations.</p>
<h5><strong>3.6 Items suited for use in aviation or the space industry (Annex XVII of Regulation 765/2006)</strong></h5>
<p><strong>New derogations</strong> &#8211; NCAs may authorize:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Transactions necessary for the production of titanium goods for the aeronautic industry for which no alternative supply is available;</li>
    <li>Technical assistance necessary to avoid collision between satellites or unintended re-entry into the atmosphere; and</li>
    <li>Certain transactions related to the fulfilment of maintenance obligations by Member States in areas under long-term lease agreements with Belarus.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>3.7 Introduction of new categories of items subject to export-related restrictions </strong></h5>
<p><strong>New categories of export-controlled items</strong> &#8211; In order to align sanctions against Belarus with those targeting Russia under Regulation 833/2014, the following categories of items are now subject to export-related controls:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Items which could contribute to the enhancement of Belarusian industrial capacities ("<strong>industrial items</strong>"), as listed in a new Annex XVIII of Regulation 765/2006;</li>
    <li>Maritime navigation goods and technology, as listed in a new Annex XXIV of Regulation 765/2006;</li>
    <li>Luxury goods, as listed in a new Annex XXV of Regulation 765/2006, where their value exceeds EUR 300 per item or a higher value as set forth in Annex XXV; and</li>
    <li>Items suited for use in oil refining and liquefaction of natural gas, as listed in a new Annex XX of Regulation 765/2006.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scope of prohibitions </strong>&#8211; In relation to newly controlled categories of items, prohibition apply in relation to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Their sale, supply, transfer or export to any person in Belarus or for use in Belarus;</li>
    <li>The provision of associated services (technical assistance, brokering services, other services, financing or financial assistance) to any person in Belarus or for use in Belarus; and</li>
    <li>IPR and trade secrets provision to any person in Belarus or for Belarus.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, for industrial items listed in Annex XIX of Regulation 765/2006,<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9">9</a> transit of these items via Belarus is prohibited if they were exported from the EU.</p>
<p><strong>Exemption and derogations </strong>&#8211; Exemptions and derogations have been introduced as follows:</p>

<h4>8. Authorizing the Release of Goods Presented to Customs Before Sanctions Became Applicable</h4>
<p>In line with facilitations provided for under Regulation 833/2014 for Russia, Regulation 765/2006 now clarifies that goods that were presented to customs before sanctions became applicable may be released, and all procedural steps for that purpose shall be allowed, provided that customs authorities (i) have no reasonable grounds to suspect circumvention and (ii) do not authorize re-export of the goods to Belarus.</p>
<p>Payments in relation to such goods must however remain consistent with the provisions and objectives of Regulation 765/2006.</p>
<h4>9. Facilitating Divestments from Belarus</h4>
<p>Derogations pursuant to which NCA may authorize transactions that would otherwise fall under trade control measures or services and software restrictions, but are necessary for the divestment from Belarus or the wind-down of business activities in Belarus have been introduced and can be obtained until December 31, 2024.</p>
<p>This concerns:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>For export-related restrictions</strong>: advanced technology items (Annex Va), goods used for the production or manufacturing of tobacco products (Annex VI), machineries (Annex XIV), goods and technology suited for use in aviation or the space industry (Annex XVII), industrial items (Annex XVIII), goods and technology suited for use in oil refining and liquefaction of natural gas (Annex XX), maritime navigation goods and technology (Annex XXIV) and luxury goods (Annex XXV);</li>
    <li><strong>For import-related restrictions</strong>: mineral products (Annex VII), wood products (Annex X), cement products (Annex XI), iron and steel products (Annex XII), rubber products (Annex XIII), gold and gold products (Annexes XXI and XXII) and goods which allow Belarus to diversify its sources of revenue (Annex XXVII).</li>
    <li><strong>For services and software restrictions</strong>: all services covered by Article 1jc of Regulation 765/2006 and software covered by Annex XXVI.&#160;</li>
</ul>
<h4>10. Revising the List of Partner Countries</h4>
 
<p>The list of partner countries in Annex Vb of Regulation 765/2006, which was previously empty, now includes Norway, Switzerland, the United States of America, Japan, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Liechtenstein and Iceland. </p>
<p>Partner countries benefit from various exemptions or derogations under Regulation 765/2006.</p>
<h4>11. Reinforcing Enforcement</h4>
<h5><strong>11.1 Introduction of reporting obligations</strong></h5>
<p>EU operators are now required to supply information that facilitate the implementation of Regulation 765/2006 to their NCAs within two weeks of acquiring this information and cooperate with NCAs in any verification of such information.</p>
<p>Member States must then transmit relevant information within one month to the Commission, possibly in an anonymized form.</p>
<p>This obligation must be applied consistently with respect for the confidentiality of communications between lawyers and, in certain circumstances, other certified professionals and their clients.</p>
<h5><strong>11.2 Enhanced information exchanges on enforcement actions</strong></h5>
 
<p>In addition to violation and enforcement problems and judgments handed down by national courts, Member States are now expressly required to inform each other and the European Commission on penalties applied for infringements of EU sanctions under Regulation 765/2006.</p>
<h5><strong>11.3 Enhanced confidentiality requirements for enforcement matters</strong> <strong>and sanctions proposals </strong></h5>
<p>Information exchanged, including with individuals or entities, to ensure enforcement of EU sanctions set forth in Regulation 765/2006 or prevent violation or circumvention is subject to professional secrecy and must enjoy the protection afforded by the rules applicable to EU institutions.</p>
<p>The same applies to joint proposals for amendments to Regulation 765/2006 and preparatory documents related to them.</p>
<h5><strong>11.4 Promoting voluntary self-disclosures</strong></h5>
 
<p>Although no voluntary self-disclosure mechanism has been established, Regulation 765/2006 now provides that penalties may take take into account the voluntary, complete and timely self-disclosure of infringements of these Regulations as a mitigating factor, in accordance with respective national laws. </p>
<h4>12. Introducing New Damages Recovery Actions</h4>
 
<p>EU nationals and entities are entitled to seek the recovery of damages resulting from claims lodged with non-EU courts in connection with a contract or transaction the performance of which has been affected by EU sanctions imposed under Regulation 765/2006, whereas such claims would not have been satisfied in the EU due to the no claims clause, provided that the person concerned does not have effective access to the remedies under the relevant jurisdiction.</p>
<p>This reflects a similar action for damages introduced in Regulation 833/2014 against Russia, as part of efforts to reinforce the effectiveness of "no claims" clauses, which was jeopardized by claims made in third-countries.</p>
<h4>13. Clarifications of the Concept of Circumvention</h4>
<p>In accordance with settled case-law, and as previously done in Regulation 833/2014 regarding Russia, the provisions on circumvention in Regulation 765/2006 have been reinforced to clarify that circumvention includes participating in activities the object or effect of which is to circumvent EU sanctions without deliberately seeking that object or effect but being aware that the participation can have that object or effect and accepting that possibility.</p>
