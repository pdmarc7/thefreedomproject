								<p>RICHMOND &#8212; Jack Ernest. President of the Veterans Service Commission of Jefferson County. Chaplain for the Combat Veteran&#8217;s Support Group of Steubenville. Jefferson County&#8217;s Veteran of the Year in 2007. A commissioner for the Veteran&#8217;s Service Commission for the state of Ohio. </p>
<p>Jack Ernest. A 2012 inductee into the state of Ohio&#8217;s Veterans Hall of Fame in Columbus. Recipient of the Legion of Honor award. A 2019 inductee into the Chapel of the Four Chaplains in Philadelphia. </p>
<p>Jack Ernest. An exemplary example of the term hero. </p>
<p>And yet, the former Marine sergeant who resides in Richmond with his wife of more than 54 years, Patsy, would never even consider boasting or bragging about his accomplishments. </p>
<p>Because along with every medal, every ribbon, every badge &#8230; there is a great deal of heartache that came with each. </p>
<p>Ernest explained he grew up during a time when young men were expected to serve their country. Just as his uncles, cousins and two brothers had. And so, in July of 1965, at the age of 19, that young boy and his good friend enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. </p>
<p>They signed up together, went through basic training together and wanted to remain together. However, they were later sent in opposite directions. </p>
<p>Ernest started out as a rifleman 0311. Being a Marine &#8212; specifically, a sharpshooter and member of the infantry &#8212; it would be only a matter of time before he was sent to Vietnam. </p>
<p>So, he volunteered. </p>
<p>It was important to him that he try and take the place of another soldier. Someone&#8217;s husband. Someone&#8217;s father. A family man who might not have to go. </p>
<p>Sent overseas in October 1966, Ernest started out as a &#8220;grunt.&#8221; After seven months of engaging in combat operations, he was told by his commissioned officer to pack his bags. He would be leaving in the morning to attend a Vietnamese language school in Okinawa, Japan. </p>
<p>Being one of two men chosen for this challenge, the now lance corporal studied eight hours a day, five days a week for 35 days. It was intense training taught by Vietnamese natives. Upon returning to his unit, Ernest was promoted to an E-4, a corporal, and transferred to a scout team where he worked with a North Vietnamese soldier who had joined the side of the Americans. </p>
<p>Ernest was made chief scout, in charge of 12 scout teams and training others. He also was put in charge of his company&#8217;s prisoner of war compound, questioning and interrogating captured enemy soldiers. </p>
<p>Believing he was safe from harm, he soon realized just how wrong he had been. While engaged with the enemy on July 24, 1967, Ernest made an attempt to save a Marine who had been shot. He was wounded by shrapnel, yelling for help. He would come home to the United States soon after, in October 1967. Unfortunately, his friend never came home again. </p>
<p>Ernest returned from the Vietnam War having earned a Purple Heart. </p>
<p>It was a time of protests. A country which had become filled with hatred. Hatred for American soldiers, many of whom were still teenagers. They were spat on, declared rapists and murderers, baby killers and worse. </p>
<p>Ernest explained he was unable to withstand the hatred. He returned to serve out his remaining year-and-a-half and was promoted to sergeant. He was stationed at the Norfolk Naval base where he became attached to the Naval barracks, the unit responsible for the base&#8217;s security. </p>
<p>Discharged by the Marines in 1969, that 19-year-old all these years later still becomes emotional when speaking of his return home. </p>
<p>&#8220;Here I was trying to come back into a society that doesn&#8217;t want you,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Unbeknownst to me, I was suffering from PTSD. Things you see in war stay with you the rest of your life. You can hit the delete button all you want, but you can never eliminate the things you saw and did.&#8221; </p>
<p>The war had taken its toll. Agent Orange was causing cancer and heart problems. Those struggles eventually led to drinking, drugs and fighting. But at the age of 30, something inside Ernest changed. </p>
<p>He had gone to church with his father, where a John Wayne-type man was giving a testimony about his life. It was exactly what he had been going through. </p>
<p>Following that testimony, the man told his audience, &#8220;Who so ever will, may come. This altar is open. God is no respecter of past sins. His door is always open.&#8221; </p>
<p>It was then Ernest gave his life to the Lord. He obtained employment at Weirton Steel, where he worked until retiring in 1994. He and Patsy share a daughter, Cindy, who resides with her husband, Scott, in Columbus. </p>
<p>Twenty-two years after returning from Vietnam, in 1989, he was contacted by a ministry called Welcome Home, an organization designed to assist veterans in integrating themselves back into society. </p>
<p>Former &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; newsman Morley Safer contacted the organization for a story he was doing. Safer was writing a book entitled, &#8220;Flashbacks, Returning to Vietnam.&#8221; The organization reached out to Ernest and the question was posed: Would he be willing to return to Vietnam once again? </p>
<p>&#8220;I was contacted and asked to return with a team of nine other combat veterans and an entire film crew who would document our time in the country,&#8221; Ernest said. &#8220;This would be extremely difficult for me to do &#8212; return to the country where I almost died twice. I was just 19 years old.&#8221; </p>
<p>Ernest said he almost declined the offer. But something inside him &#8230; God, was telling him he should go. </p>
<p>Ernest was in Vietnam for 21 days. He would eventually go back 43 more times. </p>
<p>Why? </p>
<p>For the next 18 years, he worked with orphanages, hospitals and the underground church. </p>
<p>He had been given this opportunity to bring along other Vietnam veterans who were in need of closure. And he was able to help arrange for many young children to be adopted into the U.S. </p>
<p>&#8220;Because of my language training in 1967, I was able to communicate with the people and accomplish so many wonderful things,&#8221; Ernest commented. &#8220;We assisted in remodeling many orphanages and in bringing in medicines they were not able to obtain themselves.&#8221; </p>
<p>Ernest explained God had restored his ability to speak the language, making everything possible. It had been 24 years since he left, never to have spoken those foreign words again. </p>
<p>Ernest said studies and research have shown a person loses the ability to speak a language after not using it for more than six years. God had other plans. </p>
<p>He served with the organization Operation Blessing International on a medical mission in Vietnam during August 2001. </p>
<p>He received his ordination as a minister Aug. 31, 1989, with the international ministries known as the Association of Evangelical Gospel Assemblies. He was later ordained as a bishop with the same organization and received his doctor of divinity in June 2005. </p>
<p>Ernest retired from Asia in 2005. He was installed as one of three presiding bishops overseeing the international ministry worldwide. </p>
<p>Among his awards and honors are the Purple Heart, Combat Action ribbon, National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal with two stars, Vietnam Campaign Medal, Good Conduct Medal, two presidential unit citations, Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry with Palm, Vietnam Civil Action Medal and a Rifle Marksmanship badge.</p>
<p>During the many veterans functions which Ernest attends, he explained there a lot of men who approach him once he has concluded his speech. </p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe they went to Germany instead of Vietnam,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Often, they tell me they feel guilty they didn&#8217;t have to endure the same fate that so many did in Vietnam.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;I would tell them, &#8216;You didn&#8217;t have to go through what I did, so please don&#8217;t feel guilty,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We all served one way or another.&#8221; </p>
