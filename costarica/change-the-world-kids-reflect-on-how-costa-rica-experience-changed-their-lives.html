					<div><p><b>By Tom Ayres , </b>Senior Staff Writer</p>
<p>A dozen tired but eminently energized and engaged youths returned to the area last Friday, following the Woodstock-based Change the World Kids (CTWK) organization&#8217;s 20th annual 10-day excursion to Monteverde, Costa Rica, to take part in an internationally acclaimed reforestation project in what is known as the <i><span>Bosque para Siempre</span></i> &#8212;&#8220;The Forever Forest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Four of the twelve CTWK youths capped a weekend of resting, relaxing, and reconnecting with family by chatting about their experiences with the Costa Rica project and the impact it had on their lives. Three of the four CTWK activists were first timers to the Monteverde project experience, while a fourth took part in the reforestation effort for the third consecutive year, June 17-28. Rather than reiterate discussions they&#8217;d had prior to the Costa Rican trip about the physical labor of planting thousands of seedlings from a CTWK-established nursery in the mountainous Monteverde region of central Costa Rica, the youths spoke instead about the impact the expedition had on them socially, academically, and in terms of their evolving self-awareness and worldviews.</p>
 
<p>Addy Tucker, a 15-year-old from Woodstock, is a rising sophomore at Woodstock Union High School (WUHS). When she spoke about the then-impending Costa Rica trip a month ago, she was approaching the journey with some trepidation: it represented the first time she would be traveling without her parents. That unease is behind her now. &#8220;I think the trip went really well,&#8221; Tucker said Monday afternoon. &#8220;That&#8217;s despite the fact that I got sick while I was down there,&#8221; she added, reflecting on an experience that is common for world travelers. &#8220;I really liked being out there on the hill, planting and seeing all the natural scenes and the cool animals. There were some amazing frogs. There were monkeys, and lemur-type animals, and cutter ants &#8212; and there were so many different, beautiful butterflies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tucker says she flourished socially in the mountains of the Monteverde region. &#8220;It was a really good experience. I feel as if I got to know the other Change the World Kids better than I had known them previously. The teamwork was great. The (CTWK) teams really did what they were supposed to do: we were really coordinated in our planting of the trees. At one point, we planted more than 900 trees in just one morning, which is insane. We broke the overall record for trees planted by Change the World Kids this year. That was amazing. It was a physically intense experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chelsea McDermott, a 16-year-old from Woodstock who will be a junior at WUHS in the fall, returned to Costa Rica with her CTWK pals for the third time last month. She first ventured to Monteverde in 2022, in between eight-grade and her first year of high school. McDermott made that inaugural trip with her older sister, Phoebe, who graduated from WUHS last year. &#8220;I started going to Costa Rica pretty young. Living in Vermont, we don&#8217;t get to see a lot of different cultures. It&#8217;s nice to be able to open your eyes to different ways of living and seeing the world,&#8221; McDermott said. &#8220;As Change the World Kids, we try to focus on different methods of agriculture and conservation, because Vermont is such an agriculture-based place. The Costa Rica project has affected me strongly while growing up. Socially, Change the World Kids is something that I have had in my life to turn to for friends. You really grow by having those kinds of bonds together &#8212; and that&#8217;s really important, especially for a young kid.&#8221;</p>
<p>McDermott elaborated on the importance of bonding with her fellow youths by citing the example of the nightly &#8220;reflection&#8221; sessions the CTWK group held during the Costa Rica sojourn. &#8220;The reflection meetings could be anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour or more &#8212; it was a time where we could reflect about the day. Even though we spent the whole day working together &#8212; and it&#8217;s pretty rigorous work &#8212; it is sometimes hard to get to know people better during the day. The reflection meeting gave us some time to reflect more on the things we&#8217;d done together and on areas of common interest that we didn&#8217;t know we had. Sometimes it&#8217;s nice, when things go by so quickly during the day, to just slow down to a certain point and just talk to one another.&#8221; McDermott concluded by saying that she has grown so committed to the Costa Rica reforestation effort that she will return to Monteverde for a summer-long internship next year.</p>
 
<p>Eryn McGuire, 17, is headed into her senior year at WUHS. The South Woodstock resident is exploring college options with the hope of entering a pre-med program and eventually becoming a doctor. A newbie to the Costa Rica project, McGuire waxed enthusiastically about the experience three days after returning home from Costa Rica. &#8220;This was my first year and I really didn&#8217;t know what to expect,&#8221; McDermott said. &#8220;I really didn&#8217;t know what it would be like on a daily basis &#8212; I&#8217;d never been on a work trip before. Then when I got there, I just felt so welcomed by the people we were staying with. Everyone was so friendly &#8212; and now I literally miss Costa Rica so much. I didn&#8217;t want to leave. I will definitely be going back next year.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was basically friends with everyone on the trip beforehand, but the experience of working together in the field for hours each day really strengthened those bonds,&#8221; McGuire continued. &#8220;We all have this passion for helping other people and the community and just trying to make positive change. Pieter [Bohen, one of the adult facilitators of the CTWK efforts in Costa Rica] told us how special we were to the people of Costa Rica. We&#8217;re kind of famous down there, it turns out. After our final meeting before leaving, Victor, who lives at the lodge where we stayed and who worked with us on the project, was talking about how he was old and that when he wakes up in the morning, his muscles ache. But he said each year when we come along, it keeps him young. It&#8217;s inspiring to meet people like that, connecting with someone like him because he&#8217;s just such a good person. Costa Rica was amazing. I want to go into medicine, but I&#8217;ll never forget this trip. I want to find a way to incorporate the experience into whatever I am doing in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>WUHS senior and CTWK activist Owen Courcey, who also serves as one of two WUHS student representatives to the Mountain View School District Board of Directors, also journeyed to Costa Rica for the first time last month. &#8220;It was an incredibly gratifying experience,&#8221; Courcey, from Barnard, said late Monday. It was fascinating and the work we did was very satisfying. I walked away with a fairly authentic education in conservation. We met this diverse corps of conservation biologists down there and it gave me a strong understanding of the elements of that work. I think of myself as more of a humanities kid &#8212; an English and history kid &#8212; and I&#8217;m kind of an idiot when it comes to science,&#8221; Courcey added self-deprecatingly. &#8220;But there&#8217;s an undeniable truth that I will be thinking about our trip and our work in Costa Rica for the rest of my life in my academic and career pursuits. It&#8217;s something that I will be thinking about for a long time &#8212; how whatever I am doing is impacting that kind of conservation work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Courcey added that he felt that all the youths who participated in this year&#8217;s Costa Rica experience drew strong connections with their community work and lives back here in Vermont. Citing a local project in which CTWK members are planting oak trees to replace ash trees adversely impacted by the emerald ash borer pest, the rising WUHS senior was eloquent. &#8220;As an individual &#8212; and I hope I speak for the group &#8212; I don&#8217;t want the lessons we learned down in Costa Rica to stay there,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There are myriad ways where we can improve our own local operations such as the ash-to-oak project and improve the ways we give back to our community as a service group. We walked away from this trip with new capacities and understandings of conservation work that we can use for our communities here in the Woodstock area,&#8221; Courcey concluded.</p>
<p>The 12 local participants in CTWK&#8217;s most recent trip to Monteverde, Costa Rica, included WUHS seniors Reid Allegretti, Stella Capurso, Lucy Debritko, McGuire, and Fiona Piconi, and rising sophomore Tucker, all of Woodstock; seniors Courcey and Graham Fox of Barnard; 2024 WUHS graduates Skye Cully of Woodstock and Lila Beckwith of Bridgewater; and senior John Kyle Costeles of Hanover.</p>
<p>&#8220;Change the World Kids are legendary in the Monteverde reforestation community,&#8221; commented Pieter Bohen, who accompanied this summer&#8217;s CTWK crew on the June trip. &#8220;They have earned this respect from 20 years of dogged hard work, discipline, quality control and, at the same time, great humor and flexibility. This 2024 group kept up the tradition, planting well over our goal of 3,000 trees, mostly in the rain, and having great spirits all along. They make me optimistic for the future.&#8221;</p>
