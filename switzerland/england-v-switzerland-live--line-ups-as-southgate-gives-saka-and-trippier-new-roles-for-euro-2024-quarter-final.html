It&#8217;s a shame Marc is suspended; he&#8217;s been outstanding for us in that back four. But, look, whatever the manager decides &#8211; if I play, if I don&#8217;t play &#8211; I&#8217;ll always be ready.&#8221;</p><h2>England v Switzerland team changes</h2><p>15:55 , Mike Jones</p><p>Gareth Southgate is potentially switching things up for England despite their only being one change from the line-up that faced Slovakia in the round of 16. Marc Guehi is suspended so his replacement is Ezri Konsa.</p><p>That means England will either continue with their 4-2-3-1 formation and use Konsa as a direct replacement for Guehi or, as has been reported previously, they will switch to a back three of Konsa, John Stones and Kyle Walker with Kieran Trippier and Bukayo Saka playing as wingbacks in a 3-4-3 formation.</p><p>For Switzerland, manager Murat Yakin names the same starting XI that defeated Italy so easily in their last outing. This could be a tough one for the Three Lions.</p><h2>England v Switzerland line-ups</h2><p>15:51 , Mike Jones</p><p>England XI: Pickford; Walker, Stones, Konsa; Trippier, Rice, Mainoo, Saka; Bellingham, Foden; Kane</p><p>Switzerland XI: Sommer; Schar, Akanji, Rodriguez; Rieder, Freuler, Xhaka, Aebischer; Vargas, Ndoye, Embolo</p><h2>More from Southgate on Shaw</h2><p>15:46 , Mike Jones</p><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not concerned that he would break down but there&#8217;s obviously a decision regarding match sharpness and how quickly you can adjust back into that intensity of the cauldron of the tournament.</p><p>&#8220;But we&#8217;re happy with his progress, his commitment to do that. There&#8217;s been some difficult days for him on his own through the last few weeks.</p><p>&#8220;Some great work by our medical and physical performances teams and I&#8217;m really pleased for him that he&#8217;s now an option for us. That balance is something that has been difficult for us.&#8221;</p><h2>Gareth Southgate offers Luke Shaw injury update</h2><p>15:40 , Mike Jones</p><p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/luke-shaw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">Luke Shaw</a> is finally able to make his first appearance of the tournament &#8211; and play his first game for anyone since February &#8211; when <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/england-football-team" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">England </a>face Switzerland <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/arsenal-battle-old-decide-england-061556487.html" class="link  yahoo-link">in Saturday&#8217;s quarter-final in Dusseldorf </a>and Gareth Southgate insisted he is not worried the Manchester United player will break down.</p><p>&#8220;With Luke we initially thought third group game, first knockout game,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That then looked like it might accelerate a bit, but we probably ended up sort of in the territory we thought we might be and given we had 26 we were happy to take that risk.</p><p>&#8220;We feel he can play a part now, and we&#8217;re still focused on being here for another 10 days. How much that part can be, who knows?</p><p>&#8220;But as we&#8217;ve seen in the tournament with the impact our substitutions have made, then, you know, five minutes, 30 minutes, 90 minutes, could be critical at any point. I&#8217;m pleased we&#8217;ve got him here because he&#8217;s unique in terms of the attributes he&#8217;s got for the position that he plays.&#8221;</p><h2>England fans arrive for Euro 2024 quarter-final against Switzerland at Dusseldorf Arena</h2><p>15:33 , Mike Jones</p><p>Football fans are arriving at the Merkur Spiel-Arena in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/dusseldorf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">Dusseldorf</a> as <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/england" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">England</a> prepares to take on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/switzerland" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">Switzerland</a> in the quarter-final of Euro 20204.</p><p>The match marks <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/gareth-southgate" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">Gareth Southgate</a>&#8217;s 100th game as manager, and could mark a change in tactics for England, who have so far struggled to make an impact in the tournament.</p><p><a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/watch-live-england-fans-arrive-125807966.html" class="link  yahoo-link">Watch live: England fans arrive for Euro 2024 quarter-final against Switzerland</a></p><h2>Turkey defender Merih Demiral handed Euro 2024 ban over &#8216;Grey Wolves&#8217; gesture</h2><p>15:27 , Mike Jones</p><p>Turkey defender Merih Demiral has been banned for two games by <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/uefa" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">Uefa</a> following a gesture he made during his side&#8217;s last-16 win against Austria on Tuesday and will miss Saturday&#8217;s <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/euro-2024" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">Euro 2024</a> quarter-final against Netherlands.</p><p>The 26-year-old centre back scored twice <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/merih-demiral-uefa-investigation-salute-turkey-euro-2024-b2573214.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">in a 2-1 win over the Austrians</a> to send his side into the last eight for the first time since 2008, and celebrated by making a &#8220;wolf&#8221; gesture with his fingers.</p><p>The gesture is linked to the &#8220;Grey Wolves&#8221;, an ultra-nationalist youth branch of Turkey&#8217;s Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), which is an ally of President Tayyip Erdogan&#8217;s ruling AK Party.</p><p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/merih-demiral-turkey-ban-suspended-euro-2024-b2575157.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">Turkey defender Merih Demiral handed Euro 2024 ban over &#8216;Grey Wolves&#8217; gesture</a></p><h2>Southgate&#8217;s response to Jude Bellingham escaping ban</h2><p>15:21 , Mike Jones</p><p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a common-sense decision. Clearly it&#8217;s an unprecedented moment in someone&#8217;s life to score a goal like that in the 96th minute. I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;d have reacted in that moment if that was me, at his age as well.</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just so mindful of everything he&#8217;s achieving and the spotlight on his world and at that age &#8211; or any age &#8211; nobody is going to be perfect so at 21 you are at times going to react emotionally and without that emotion I don&#8217;t think you have the type of player he is, so I think he actually deals with everything so well.&#8221;</p><h2>Gareth Southgate gives response to Jude Bellingham escaping ban for crotch grab</h2><p>15:15 , Mike Jones</p><p>Gareth Southgate feels it is a &#8220;common-sense&#8221; decision not to suspend Jude Bellingham for <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/jude-bellingham-explains-joke-gesture-113312338.html" class="link  yahoo-link">his crotch-grabbing celebration</a> against Slovakia and insisted the midfielder shows great maturity in how he reacts to his eventful life.</p><p>The <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/jude-bellingham-fined-uefa-handed-111752333.html" class="link  yahoo-link">midfielder was found guilty</a> of &#8220;violating the basic rules of decent conduct&#8221; by Uefa and was fined &#8364;30,000 and given a one-match ban, which is suspended for a year, so he will be allowed to play in England football team&#8217;s Euro 2024 quarter-final <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/gareth-southgate-faces-euro-2024-213016689.html" class="link  yahoo-link">against Switzerland on Saturday.</a></p><p>England manager Southgate feels the Real Madrid footballer would be a lesser player if he did not act with such emotion and believes Uefa were right not to opt for a more severe punishment.</p><p><a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/gareth-southgate-gives-response-jude-213027273.html" class="link  yahoo-link">Gareth Southgate gives response to Jude Bellingham escaping ban for crotch grab</a></p><h2>The Arsenal battle of old and new that will decide England v Switzerland at Euro 2024</h2><p>15:09 , Karl Matchett</p><p>Like too many of his international teammates, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/declan-rice" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">Declan Rice</a> has not been at his very best level at <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/euro-2024" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">Euro 2024</a>. Too few times has he been able to surge forward in possession. He&#8217;s winning fewer duels per 90 minutes, has been successful in fewer aerial challenges and has been dispossessed more often in Germany than he did during the Premier League season with Arsenal.</p><p>Of course, there&#8217;s another difference, too, which makes the above comparisons both eye-opening and irrelevant all at once: he&#8217;s not playing the same role for <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/england-football-team" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">England </a>as he does for the Gunners, so why would he achieve the same things?</p><p>Indeed, that seems to be a theme this summer in the Three Lions&#8217; camp.

England&#8217;s win rate is 48.5% with a back three or back five under Southgate, compared to a 60.5% win rate overall.</p><h2>Early Switzerland team news</h2><p>14:36 , Mike Jones</p><p>Switzerland strolled through against Italy with no further apparent injury concerns or bookings, with Silvan Widmer now back from a ban. Denis Zakaria still hasn&#8217;t played at the tournament as he nurses ongoing fitness issues.</p><p>Granit Xhaka had to have scans on an adductor injury, but he has been cleared to play.</p><p>The Swiss have played several different personnel throughout the tournament so far, though their 3-4-2-1-type formation has remained the same throughout. Dan Ndoye has popped up on at right-back and on both sides of the advanced midfield two, with Breel Embolo likely to lead the line and Ruben Vargas likely to start in an attacking role.</p><p>Manuel Akanji and Fabian Schar will keep their places in defence, with Remo Freuler, Granit Xhaka and Michel Aebischer probably making up the rest of the midfield.</p><h2>Early England team news</h2><p>14:29 , Mike Jones</p><p>The big news for England is that Jude Bellingham has avoided a suspension for the quarter-final, with <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/jude-bellingham-fined-uefa-handed-111752333.html" class="link  yahoo-link">the midfielder receiving a fine and a suspended ban</a> for his gesture against Slovakia.</p><p>Regarding the decision, Uefa said that &#8220;said suspension is not immediately enforced and is subject to a probationary period of one year starting from the date of the present decision.&#8221;</p><p>Marc Guehi is suspended meaning England&#8217;s back line will change for the first time at the tournament. Lewis Dunk, Joe Gomez and Ezri Konsa are the options, with the latter possibly first in line after an appearance already, albeit as sub at left-back.</p><p>However, England may need an alteration at left-back too after Kieran Trippier went off injured in the last game, with Luke Shaw not yet considered ready for action by the head coach. Gomez or Konsa can fill in there - but Kyle Walker shifting across and Trent Alexander-Arnold playing on the right is also a consideration if Trippier doesn&#8217;t return.</p><p>There have been <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/england-working-bold-tactical-switch-181605456.html" class="link  yahoo-link">rumours of England fielding a back three</a>, with Bukayo Saka coming in at left wing-back, where he originally made his name at Arsenal.</p><p>There remain concerns over the best partner for Declan Rice in midfield, but it is likely that Kobbie Mainoo will start once more.</p><h2>England working on bold tactical switch for Euro 2024 quarter-final</h2><p>14:22 , Mike Jones</p><p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/england-football-team" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">England </a>have been working on a back three in training ahead of the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/euro-2024" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">Euro 2024</a> quarter-final against Switzerland, with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/kyle-walker" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">Kyle Walker</a> moved to the right of centre-half and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/bukayo-saka" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">Bukayo Saka</a> potentially playing as a left wingback. <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/gareth-southgate" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link ">Gareth Southgate</a> is now actively considering a formation change, in what could yet be a decisive mid-tournament switch.</p><p>The manager had been fretting about how his initial system hadn&#8217;t been working in four laboured displays so far but a number of factors have forced him to finally work on something different in the build-up to the Switzerland game.</p><p>The primary reason was a required change to the defence anyway, with <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/england-face-potential-quarter-final-163009026.html" class="link  yahoo-link">Marc Guehi suspended</a> after a second booking of the tournament in the 2-1 win over Slovakia.</p><p><a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/england-working-bold-tactical-switch-181605456.html" class="link  yahoo-link">England working on bold tactical switch for Euro 2024 quarter-final</a></p><h2>Southgate to switch to a back three?</h2><p>14:14 , Mike Jones</p><p>England could line up with a back three against Switzerland after their previous formation of 4-2-3-1 has so far proved to be lacklustre.</p><p>Manager Gareth Southgate has been drilling the change of system in training but it remains to be seen if he switches things up for this quarter-final fixture having pointed to criticism for using the system before.</p><p>Although a mid-tournament change of formation is a radical move by him, playing with a back three is hardly uncharted territory for this England who used this formation to superb effect during the 2018 World Cup and against Germany at Euro 2020.</p><h2>England&#8217;s route to the final: Possible opponents in the Euro 2024 knockout stages</h2><p>14:07 , Mike Jones</p><p><strong>Quarter-final: Dusseldorf, Saturday 6 July</strong></p><p><strong>Switzerland</strong> await.

To not put Trent in that position, I cannot believe that one.&#8221;</p><h2>Jamie Carragher &#8216;can&#8217;t believe&#8217; Trippier given nod over Alexander-Arnold</h2><p>13:45 , Mike Jones</p><p>Jamie Carragher stopped by the Sky Sports studio to address the rumours that Gareth Southgate will set England up in a back three and have Bukayo Saka and Kieran Trippier in the wingback roles.</p><p>Carragher says he can&#8217;t fathom why Southgate would elect to go with the Newcastle defender over Liverpool&#8217;s Trent Alexander-Arnold as this formation is built to allow wingbacks more attacking freedom.</p><p>Take a look at what he told Sky below:</p><h2>Harry Kane lauds Gareth Southgate&#8217;s England milestone</h2><p>13:45 , Jack Rathborn</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an incredible achievement,&#8221; Harry Kane said of Gareth Southgate making it to 100 matches.</p><p>&#8220;It just shows his standards and the consistency that he&#8217;s shown along with the coaching staff as well. Incredible consistency over a long period of time and to reach 100 games is really, really special.</p><p>&#8220;He&#8217;s changed a lot in terms of our national team in his tenure since he&#8217;s been here. Not just on the pitch and off the pitch as well, and the connections we&#8217;ve had with the fans and the media, and he&#8217;s allowed people to open up and be themselves.</p><p>&#8220;That&#8217;s been a big turning point in our careers as England players.
