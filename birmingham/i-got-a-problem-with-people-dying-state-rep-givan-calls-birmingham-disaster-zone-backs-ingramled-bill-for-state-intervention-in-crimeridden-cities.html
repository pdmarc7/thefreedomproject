                        <p>State Rep. Juandalynn Givan (D-Birmingham) has a message for Birmingham city leaders, and she says it&#8217;s not personal, it&#8217;s business.</p><p>"We're in a state of emergency,&#8221; Givan told 1819 News about high crime in the city. &#8220;Birmingham is a disaster zone on any given day because of the crime. It's a great city. It's the Magic City, but it is now becoming the city of horrors. And when I say horrors, I mean bodies dropping at any given time. Something's got to give."</p><p>Givan told 1819 News that it was time for policy-makers to come together to make a change. She wants city leaders in Birmingham to start listening to the community and lawmakers because people are terrified of living in Birmingham.</p><p>&#8220;We have too many bodies dropping,&#8221; said Givan. &#8220;It's one body after another. Killing. It's crazy. You can't even go to the store.&#8221;</p><p>In her district, Givan said she has heard from elderly people who are scared to work in their yards. Others have said 911 response times are too long to make a difference in some cases.</p><p>Givan said she was sickened by what she had seen with her own eyes, and if nothing was done, she was worried about what could happen.</p><p>&#8220;Listen, if you go up Third Avenue on Saturday, it's a zoo,&#8221; Givan said. &#8220;People have taken over the street. The exhibition driving was so out of hand that I got stuck in one. Oh, I've never been that scared in my life.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;A little 16-year-old boy just died a few weeks back. Listen, why? He went to the store, and he looked at a guy,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Now, that boy was offended. He had left home only for a few minutes and now he&#8217;s dead.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;We just had a five-year-old baby killed; the mother and father also killed,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;Come on, people. That was awful. All of this just didn't happen.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I try to stay in my lane, but at this point, I do have a problem with people dying,&#8221; the Democrat state representative said. &#8220;I got a problem with that.&#8221;</p><p>Givan wants leaders to support law enforcement but does not believe in defunding the police movement. She has seen firsthand how that type of mindset can increase crime, and she doesn&#8217;t want police to be scared to do their jobs.</p><p>&#8220;So, when you say defund the police, I say, hell no,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Hell no to defunding the police. You need the police now more than ever, and anyone who came up with that crazy sentiment, defund the police, I say hell no.&#8221;</p><p>She also believes city leaders must get serious about enforcing crime and pursuing justice.</p><p>&#8220;We've got to stop playing with these criminals,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We need to call them out for what they are.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;If you are a murderer and you would dare to kill someone's child, to rape someone, to attempt to run over someone, to brutally assault, to maim someone, you should be called out for the criminal that you are,&#8221; she added. &#8220;Call them out.&#8221;</p><p><a href="https://realestate.usnews.com/places/rankings/most-dangerous-places" target="_blank">U.S. News &amp; World Report</a> ranked the city of Birmingham the fourth most dangerous city in the United States based on FBI murder and property crime rates.</p><p>&#8220;The realization is the articles are not lying,&#8221; Givan told 1819 News.</p><p>Givan said that is a sign that it&#8217;s time for a big change, and that is why she supports <a href="https://1819news.com/news/item/state-rep-ingram-pre-files-bill-allowing-state-to-appoint-police-chief-in-cities-with-out-of-control-crime-its-life-or-death-for-some-of-these-citizens">State Rep. Reed Ingram&#8217;s (R-Pike Road) bill</a> to allow the state to appoint police chiefs in crime-ridden cities.</p><p>Givan said elected leaders of cities such as Birmingham and Montgomery have run on progressive promises that she has concerns with.</p><p>In Birmingham, Givan said a disconnect between Mayor Randall Woodfin and law enforcement has fueled many problems due to police officer shortages and lack of community engagement.</p><p>Officers have told her leadership issues are impacting morale, and they do not feel like anyone at the top has their backs. At the same time, Givan said Woodfin's authority to appoint the assistant police chief and deputy chief undermines the police chief's authority.</p><p>An issue making matters worse, Givan claims, is that criminals are aware of police shortages and the challenges law enforcement faces when it comes to solving crimes.</p><p>&#8220;You now have a criminal who is saying, &#8216;I'm bad and I'm bold and I'm big enough to kill and commit this crime because guess what? The likelihood of anyone being able to catch me now is very unlikely,&#8221; Given said. &#8220;So, now you have individuals who do not have a respect for law enforcement.&#8221;</p><p>An example of that was the July 13 shooting that left <a href="https://1819news.com/news/item/seven-killed-in-two-separate-birmingham-shootings-saturday">four people dead</a> at an event center in Birmingham. Givan said that the shooting happened less than a block away from a police precinct.</p><p>&#8220;It wasn't even three seconds away from the police precinct in the area,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So, you mean to tell me you're bold enough to kill four damn people, drive up, shoot, kill one and then kill three more and the police station is a stone's throw away? Something's wrong with it.&#8221;</p><p>Another issue that bothers Givan is a cultural shift in the community when it comes to the mindset of young people.</p><p>&#8220;But the realization is we also live in a time in which people no longer believe in fighting honorably,&#8221; Givan added. &#8220;I fought with my fist &#8230; The realization now is people don't believe in that. They believe that the only way they can be on top or be deemed the winner is if they pull the trigger.&#8221;</p><p>Givan wants to see discussions on hiring and retaining officers, restoring community policing and improving leadership cooperation between agencies to tackle problems from the top down. Other recommendations Givan made were opening up a hiring stream that goes out of state to recruit officers and offer competitive pay and benefits.</p><p>&#8220;The mayor needs to listen,&#8221; Givan said. &#8220;The Birmingham City Council needs to listen. The Birmingham City Council president, I have the utmost of respect for and this is not about personalities. This is not personal. This is business. You cannot be so offended that you don't want to listen to people.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I got a problem with people dying,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It ain't personal. This is business.&#8221;</p><p>For now, Givan said she will continue to support sensible policy. She said progressive policy does not always mean productive policy.</p><p>&#8220;Bottom line is we have mayors in certain cities who ran on being progressive,&#8221; Givan explained. &#8220;It just so happens though, that the mayors that ran on being progressive are in the two of the most major cities here in the state. And instead of people accepting criticism as constructive, they are offended.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220; &#8230; Well, in this instance dealing with this crime, you're going to need some help, and you have got to listen to somebody,&#8221; she said of the mayors in Montgomery and Birmingham. &#8220;It's just too bad. And I don't care who it is &#8212; Democrat, Republican, black or white, old or young.</p><p>To connect with the author of this story or to comment, email <a href="mailto:erica.thomas@1819news.com" target="_blank">erica.thomas@1819news.com</a>.</p>
