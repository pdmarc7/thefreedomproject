					<div><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">A 1-1 draw through regulation Friday night in Arlington, Texas pushed the Copa America quarterfinal matchup between Venezuela and Canada to penalty kicks.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The teams were even at 3-3 after five attempts each. Following a miss from Venezuela's Wilker A&#769;ngel, Ismae&#776;l Kone&#769; stepped into the box for Canada with a chance to win the game.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">He hesitated slightly before burying the ball in the left corner of the net to advance Canada to the semifinals of the team's first Copa America.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Friday's quarterfinal match saw an early goal by Canada's Jacob Shaffelburg in the 13th minute. The Copa America debutant kept that lead through halftime and into the second half as Venezuela turned up the energy and pressure.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Venezuela's vice captain Salomo&#769;n Rondo&#769;n notched the equalizer in the 65th minute and that score held through the end of stoppage time. Kone&#769;'s shot secured Canada's second win in the tournament to move them on to another matchup with tournament favorite Argentina.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">Down to the wire:</strong><a href="/story/sports/soccer/2024/07/04/copa-america-quarterfinal-argentina-ecuador-score-highlights/74301166007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Argentina bails out Messi in shootout to advance past Ecuador in Copa Ame&#769;rica thriller</a></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">When does Canada play next?</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Canada will be back in action on Tuesday in East Rutherford, New Jersey to take on Argentina for the second time in the Copa America. The two teams faced off in Group A with Argentina winning 2-0. Kick off is set for 8 p.m. ET.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">Canada vs. Venezuela highlights</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Canada got on the board early behind Shaffelburg's shot in front of the goal.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In honor of teammate Tajon Buchanan, who is sidelined with an injury from training, Shaffelburg sprinted to the sideline to raise Buchanan's jersey up in celebration.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Venezuela finally got on the board thanks to Rondo&#769;n - the most experienced player in the national team's history - floating the ball past Canadian keeper Maxime Cre&#769;peau for his third goal of the tournament.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">After 11 penalty kicks, Kone&#769; made the 12th and final shot of the night to give Canada the victory.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The teams traded makes and misses over the first 10 shots before A&#769;ngel's miss and Kone&#769;'s make.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">  Ismae&#776;l Kone&#769; seals the win for Canada</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The second-half substitution fired the ball into the left corner for Canada to get the 4-3 edge in penalties and win their quarterfinal match with Venezuela.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">  Alphonso Davies makes clutch penalty kick</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Venezuela's Jhonder Ca&#769;diz made it 3-2 with the game on the line for Davies. Canada's captain sank his attempt to make it 3-3.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">  Both teams miss fourth kick</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Venezuela's Jefferson Savarino and Canada's Stephen Eusta&#769;quio missed their team's fourth shot.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">  Penalties at 2-2 following third kick</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Toma&#769;s Rinco&#769;n made the third shot for Venezuela. Canada's Moi&#776;se Bombito responded with a make in the far right corner of the net.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">  Both teams trade makes, misses</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Salomo&#769;n Rondo&#769;n and Jonathan David each made the first kick for Venezuela and Canada, respectively. Venezuela's Angel Herrera and Canada's Liam Millar missed the second penalty kick.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">  End of regulation: Venezuela 1, Canada 1</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Multiple shots for both teams in the final 15 minutes failed to connect and, after four minutes of stoppage time, referees ended regulation to send this matchup to penalties. Yesterday's Argentina-Ecuador match went to penalties as well.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">  Yellow card for Venezuela (94')</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Canada's Liam Millar had a breakaway attempt and Venezuela's Jon Aramburu tripped him up to avoid a shot at goal. His effort earned a yellow card.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">  Canada misses multiple shots in closing minutes (89')</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Ali Ahmed had a great chance on goal but his shot went wide left. A minute later, Ismae&#776;l Kone&#769;'s curving shot went wide right of goal.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">  Substitutions for Venezuela (83')</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Mati&#769;as Lacava enters the game for his international debut for Eduard Bello and Jefferson Savarino enters the pitch for Yeferson Soteldo.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">  Another substitution for Canada (82')</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Ismae&#776;l Kone&#769; enters the game for Jonathan Osorio.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">  Oluwaseyi's first shot misses high (77')</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Minutes after entering the game, Tani Oluwaseyi earned a great opportunity from the center of the box from a pass by Derek Cornelius. The shot barely missed the crossbar as the game remains 1-1.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">  Substitutions for Canada (73')</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Cyle Larin and Richie Laryea are out with Tani Oluwaseyi and Ali Ahmed taking their places.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">  GOAL: Venezuela 1, Canada 1 (64')</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">A clearance by Jon Aramburu left Venezuelan vice-captain Salomo&#769;n Rondo&#769;n one-on-one on the attacking side and he floated a shot over Canadian keeper Maxime Cre&#769;peau, who was too far outside of the box to catch it.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">  Cre&#769;peau deflects a shot from Bello (58')</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Venezuelan winger Eduard Bello nearly scored his third goal of the tournament after a cross from Yeferson Soltedo. Cre&#769;peau leapt up and knocked it above the goal to keep it 1-0.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">  Larin's shot sails over the net (52')</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">A great pass down the right side of the field put Canada in a great spot in the box. Cyle Larin - the active scoring leader for Canada - hastily put up a shot and it went over the net to remain 1-0.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">  Yellow card No. 2 for Canada (50')</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Centre-back Derek Cornelius was shown the yellow for contact with Venezuela's Yeferson Soteldo.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">  HALFTIME: Canada 1, Venezuela 0</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Jacob Shaffelburg's goal in the 13th minute remains the difference in the game as both teams head to the locker room.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Possession is nearly even over the first 45 minutes of play. Venezuela's outshot Canada 10-7 but Canada has more shots on goal with four to Venezuela's two.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">  Eusta&#769;quio ends chance for Venezuela (45')</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Four minutes of stoppage time were added at the end of the first half. Venezuela had a good chance with a set piece but Stephen Eusta&#769;quio intercepted a pass and cleared out the chance to keep it 1-0 for at least a few minutes longer.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">  Yellow card for Shaffelburg (36')</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Canada's Jacob Shaffelburg went down with an injury and went off the field. He re-entered the field too soon afterward and was given a yellow card.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">  Canada misses another chance on goal (31')</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">After a deflection, Cyle Larin's pass missed Jonathan David's left foot by mere inches and kept the side from scoring another first-half goal.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">  David's shot misses wide right for Canada (26')</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Shaffelburg had a breakaway counter attack from a pass by Alphonso Davies. He found Jonathan David with only Venezuela's keeper Romo in the way. David fired a shot past Romo but it sailed wide right of the goal.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">  Shaffelburg nearly scores again (24')</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">After multiple attempts from Venezuela, Canada had one of their better chances at goal with Shaffelburg firing from the center of the box following a pass from Cyle Larin. Venezuelan keeper Rafael Romo blocked it away from goal.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">  Venezuela can't connect from inside the box (20')</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Salomo&#769;n Rondo&#769;n had another good chance at a goal in but Canadian keeper Maxime Cre&#769;peau blocked it. Minutes later, Cre&#769;peau blocked Yangel Herrera's header attempt from the center of the box.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">  Shaffelburg honors teammate Buchanan</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Canadian striker Tajon Buchanan was injured during training earlier this week and will not play in today's match. Shaffelburg held up his teammate's jersey after scoring the first goal of the game.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">  Rondo&#769;n's header just wide of the goal (15')</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Venezuela's Yeferson Soteldo corraled a clearance and floated it perfectly to vice-captain Salomo&#769;n Rondo&#769;n in the middle of the box but his header attempt sailed wide left of the goal.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">  GOAL: Canada 1, Venezuela 0 (13')</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">After Cyle Larin's shot nearly led to a goal in the eighth minute, Jacob Shaffelburg capitalized on a deflection to find the right corner of the net from the center of the box. His goal is just the second of the tournament for Canada.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">  Cre&#769;peau earns early save for Canada</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">An attack from Venezuela in the opening minutes tested the Canadian keeper but he deflected the shot from Venezuela's vice captain Salomo&#769;n Rondo&#769;n.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">Venezuela vs. Canada: Time, TV, Streaming and how to watch</h2><ul class="gnt_ar_b_ul"><li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"><strong>Time:</strong> 9 p.m. ET</li><li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"><strong>Location</strong>: AT&amp;T Stadium, Arlington, Texas</li><li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"><strong>TV:</strong> FS1</li><li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"><strong>Streaming:</strong> FoxSports App, fuboTV</li></ul><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">WATCH:</strong><a href="https://www.fubo.tv/welcome?irad=343747&amp;irmp=1205322&amp;subId1=USAT&amp;subId2=Copa%20America%20-%20Argentina&amp;subId3=2024%20-%20June" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Catch all of the action from the 2024 Copa America with a fubo subscription</a></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">Venezuela vs. Canada betting: Odds and spread for Copa America</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Venezuela is slightly favored to move on to the semifinals of the 2024 Copa America, per <a href="/betting/sports/betmgm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">BetMGM's latest soccer odds</a>.</p><ul class="gnt_ar_b_ul"><li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"><strong>Moneyline:</strong> Venezuela (+165), Tie (+188), Canada (+200)</li><li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"><strong>Over/under:</strong> 2.5 goals</li></ul><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">WANNA BET?</strong><a href="/betting/sports/sportsbook" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Check out new customer offers with the best online sportsbooks and sports betting apps</a></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">  Venezuela starting lineup</h2><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">  Canada starting lineup</h2><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">  Venezuela vs. Canada predictions</h2><h3 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/venezuela/copa-america/preview/preview-venezuela-vs-canada-prediction-team-news-lineups_547364.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Sports Mole</a>: Venzuela 1, Canada 1 (Venezuela advances on penalties)</h3><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Joel Lefevre writes: "The Canadians have been a resilient group, but in a match that could be about holding your nerve, we trust the experience of players like Rondon to carry the Venezuelans through."</p><h3 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"><a href="https://www.livescore.com/en/news/venezuela-canada-predictions-copa-america-2024070310371640297/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Live Score</a>: Venzuela wins</h3><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Aidan Perkins says: "Canada have some well-known players, including Davies and David, while Venezuela are led by experienced former West Brom and Everton forward Rondon, who has scored 41 goals for his country.
