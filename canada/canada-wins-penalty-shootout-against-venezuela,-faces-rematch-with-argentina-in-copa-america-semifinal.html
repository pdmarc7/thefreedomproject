					<div><p>An American is headed to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5618920/2024/07/06/copa-america-sandstorm-unofficial-anthem/">Copa America</a> semifinal, but he doesn&#8217;t play for the U.S. men&#8217;s national team. He coaches <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/football/team/canada/">Canada</a>.</p><p>In what was one of the games of the tournament thus far, Canada and <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/football/team/venezuela/">Venezuela</a> battled through 90 minutes and penalties for the privilege of advancing in the <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/football/copa-america/">Copa America</a>. In the end, Jesse Marsch&#8217;s Canadian side came out victorious.</p><p>Canada struck first with a goal in the first half from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5568616/2024/06/20/jacob-shaffelburg-maritime-messi-canada-copa-2024/">&#8216;Maritime Messi&#8217; Jacob Shaffelburg</a>, but Venezuela&#8217;s veteran captain <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/football/player/salomon-rondon-Cez7W7Dv97jb76iP/">Salom&#243;n Rond&#243;n</a> took advantage of goalkeeper <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/football/player/maxime-crepeau-833BZCLSbkpeE0fO/">Maxime Cr&#233;peau</a> standing outside the 18-yard box and chipped in a long-range shot to equalize in the 64th minute.</p><p>The two sides traded shots throughout the match, resulting in penalties where Canada were the winners thanks to a final strike from <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/football/player/ismael-kone-vLeFLoLkqr5wcaPC/">Isma&#235;l Kon&#233;</a>. The prize? A trip to New Jersey on Tuesday for a semifinal rematch against reigning champion <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/football/team/argentina/">Argentina</a>, who looked fallible i<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5617618/2024/07/05/argentina-messi-panenka-martinez-copa-america/">n a penalty kick shootout win of its own.</a></p><p>Josh Kloke, Melanie Anzidei and Jeff Rueter take you through how it happened..</p><h2>How did Canada win it?</h2><p>An early goal from Canada. Long-range chip for Venezuela to equalize. A leave-it-all-on-the-pitch battle through 90 minutes. A laser. And a calm, cool and collected finish.</p><p>The Canadian national team showed something Friday that is very familiar in North America: grit. It&#8217;s an intangible historically seen from the U.S. men&#8217;s national team. But with the Americans bounced from the tournament in the group stage, it was Canada who filled the void.</p><p>When found in nature, few things are as dazzling as perfect symmetry. Unfortunately, few things in the sport of soccer are less natural than a penalty shootout. A game often decided by moments of transition is instead turned into a series of stand-alone events.</p><p>Despite this, Venezuela and Canada treated us to an oddly symmetrical shootout. Each team&#8217;s first kicker made their shot. Their second members both missed the target. The third kicker was back on target, before the fourth were unfortunate to have their on-frame attempts saved by the goalkeeper. As the fifth kickers found the upper corner, it was a balance that even Wes Anderson would admire.</p><p>Of course, all bets are off once the players who aren&#8217;t among a team&#8217;s first five choices are forced to step to the spot. Both teams opted for a late-game substitute to take their sixth option &#8212; a rare chance for each coach to directly impact the game mid-stride. While <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/football/player/wilker-angel-cRQfiyT55W0JXVu2/">Wilker Angel</a> had his shot saved by a redeemed Cr&#233;peau, Isma&#235;l Kon&#233; slotted his home to send Canada to a Copa Am&#233;rica semi-final.</p><p>Mere months ago, Canada looked at risk of losing all the momentum harnessed in that magical 2022 World Cup cycle. The team didn&#8217;t have a head coach, and players were frustrated at the stagnation. Now, Marsch has evoked not just the dogged determination that characterized the John Herdman era, but more consistent chance creation and a more defined team shape that could, in time, yield a more dependable threat to contend.</p><p>Jeff Rueter</p><h2>Who stood out for Canada?</h2><p>As expected, the man for Canada&#8217;s big moment was patrolling their left flank. It just wasn&#8217;t <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/football/player/alphonso-davies-qnqRAuVJiQpPXNMU/">Alphonso Davies</a>.</p><p>Marsch has opted to deploy the 23-year-old face of the program at left back, the same role he&#8217;s owned for years since moving to Bayern Munich. This doesn&#8217;t just ease the pressure on Davies &#8212; it brings more of the program&#8217;s best players (that is, the wide attackers) into the lineup to offer a more proactive approach.</p><p>Little has come easy in Shaffelburg&#8217;s career. The man lovingly known as the &#8216;Maritime Messi&#8217; came up in Nova Scotia and later through <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/football/team/torontofc/">Toronto FC</a>&#8217;s academy. While most clubs would relish a homegrown attacking option and want them to stick around, Toronto&#8217;s commitment to lavish spending in attacking roles made Shaffelburg expendable &#8212; traded within <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/football/mls/">MLS</a>&#8217;s Eastern Conference to Nashville SC.</p><p>Strong form for an otherwise struggling Nashville side helped him land a spot on this tournament&#8217;s roster. So, too, did a crucial goal in Copa Am&#233;rica qualifying against Trinidad &amp; Tobago, suggesting a player known for his hustle had a bit of big-game finishing about him. That came in handy again on Friday, as Shaffelburg was the only Canadian player to cash in on a bounty of chances in the first half.</p><p>Shaffelburg operates in a sweet spot for Marsch&#8217;s still-nascent system. Right-sided defenders will still fear Davies&#8217; every involvement more than Shaffelburg&#8217;s, while back-line anchors will stay central to neutralize <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/football/player/jonathan-david-Et4NAVPdTF6ydvmB/">Jonathan David</a> and <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/football/player/cyle-larin-yjmnG87vvfRt19Q0/">Cyle Larin</a> rather than shift focus to the greasy mullet cutting into the half-space. A cool first-touch finish was a just reward for one of North America&#8217;s most industrious players.</p><p>Jeff Rueter</p><h2>How did Venezuela find the equalizer?</h2><p>Venezuela came out in the second half knowing it needed to be more aggressive in its attack if it wanted to stand a chance at defeating a strong Canadian side that is known for its backline. <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/football/player/yeferson-soteldo-BqdVrp9NUkMNpAEW/">Yeferson Soteldo</a> and <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/football/player/jose-martinez-YWn3qPYlINZMIaFB/">Jose Martinez</a> dominated the flanks for Venezuela, persistently penetrating Canada&#8217;s defensive end, and the pressure mounted.</p><p>But it was Venezuela&#8217;s captain Rond&#243;n who gave his team the much-needed relief in the 64th minute. With Cr&#233;peau off his line, Rond&#243;n took full advantage of a long punt forward and floated a ball over the goalkeeper&#8217;s head from long-range before it bounced into the back of an open net, bringing the mostly Venezuelan crowd to their feet. The stadium roared. La Vinotinto was back in this game, and their historic run continued.</p><p>Venezuela kept up with this pace, dominating on their attacking third but, just like the rest of this match, this was a mostly even-sided battle between two countries with everything to prove. As the game clock dwindled, a frantic Fernando Batista directed his players as Canada slowly regained its composure.</p><p>La Vinotinto&#8217;s fairy tale run has come to an end, as their dreams of clinching their nation&#8217;s first-ever Copa America title comes to a screeching halt. The nation&#8217;s run in the tournament has been nothing short of historic, bringing joy to a nation that has suffered so much in recent years.</p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5615753/2024/07/05/venezuela-copa-america-baseball-soccer/" class="go-deeper"><p class="go-deeper-label">GO DEEPER</p><p class="go-deeper-title">Baseball is Venezuela's national sport - but the 2024 Copa America shows why that might be changing</p></a><p>Venezuela and <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/football/team/ecuador/">Ecuador</a> remain the lone CONMEBOL nations that have yet to win South America&#8217;s grand prize. For a nation that is not known for its football, this is a promising milestone for a nation that will now look towards clinching a qualification to a World Cup for a first time.</p><p>Melanie Anzidei</p><p>They visited him at the hospital after his surgery. They gathered outside the team hotel to welcome him back with applause. And when Shaffelburg scored Canada&#8217;s opener, the soccer world learned just how much he resonated within the team. Shaffelburg ran to the Canada bench and held up a Buchanan jersey for the 51,080 in attendance to see.</p><p>There were questions about how Canada would do without one of their better attacking players in Buchanan. But the intangible emotions his loss has stirred up seem to be propelling them.</p><p>Josh Kloke</p><h2>What does the result mean for Canada?</h2><p>For years, this Canadian team has been one of promise. Their players were young but ridiculously talented. They played in Europe and seemed capable of greatness outside of the region. Wins in World Cup qualifying over <a class="ath_autolink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/football/team/mexico/">Mexico</a> and the United States gave hope, but in seemingly every crucial tournament game, knockout round or group stage, Canada faltered. They never learned how to manage the moment.</p><p>Yet against an overwhelmingly pro-Venezuela crowd and a team that won their own group, Canada now have a signature win.</p><p>Winning a knockout round game in a major tournament shows this core is capable of considering themselves among the next echelon of teams. They managed emotions, locked down the game defensively and showed their quality when they needed to. Even if Venezuela didn&#8217;t make the most of their chances, Canada didn&#8217;t beat themselves either.</p><p>With the win Canada have, quite simply, become the kind of team they&#8217;ve long aspired to be.</p><p>Josh Kloke</p><h2>What&#8217;s next for Canada?</h2><p>Argentina vs Canada, MetLife Stadium, New Jersey.
