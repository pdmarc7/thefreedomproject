					<div><p>And with that, we wrap up this first T20I! India failed to&#160;chase the target that was below run-a-ball. But it was this&#160;Zimbabwean side that fought valiantly till the end. And as they say, cricket is a good old funny game, this one zigzagged through and through. It ended up as a sure-shot blockbuster. Zimbabwe go up 1-0 in this 5-match T20I series. It's a quick turnaround then as the 2nd T20I will be played in less than a span of 24 hours or so and will be played on 7th July, Sunday. The first ball will be bowled at 4.30 pm IST (11 am GMT). Till then, take care and cheers!</p><p>The Zimbabwean skipper, Sikandar Raza is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his all-round brilliance. He says that he feels really happy about the win but need to take one game at a time. Adds that they will enjoy this victory but the series is not over yet. Lauds the bowlers of both sides for the way they bowled. Mentions that the surface was sticky and there was turn on offer as well. Says that he is really happy that the bowlers stuck to the plans. Further says that the catching and ground fielding was amazing. States it with the crowd support, it felt like they were playing with 12 guys.</p><p>Shubman Gill, the captain of India says that&#160;they bowled pretty well. Also mentions they let themselves down in the fielding department. Adds there wasn't much pressure on their shoulders but things really didn't work for them with the bat. Says halfway down the stage they lost half their side and reckons had he stayed in the middle for long, things could have been different. Appreciates the way Washington Sundar batted out. Ends by saying overall, they didn't collectively play well as a group.</p><p>Clive Madande is in for a chat. He says that he just wanted to bat through and tried to get as many as he could. Adds that he tried to protect his partner and ended up getting 115 which was a decent total on this wicket. Shares that he told Chatara to keep it simple and tried to let him play just 2 balls in an over. Ends by saying that the talk at the halfway mark was to give it all no matter what.</p><p>Earlier in the game, India invited the hosts to have a go with the bat first. Zimbabwe were dented really badly by the Indian spinners. Ravi Bishnoi ran through their batting and finished with his career-best figures including a sensational 4-fer. He was partnered pretty well by Washington Sundar who also troubled the batters and picked a two-wicket haul. None of the Zimbabwean batters actually tried to stabilize the innings and threw their wickets away, and of course, were outfoxed by the Indian spin duo. Zimbabwe, however, crossed the triple figures thanks to Clive Madande's handy cameo of 29 that came towards the backend. In their defence, Zimbabwe executed a near-perfect fightback, barring a few moments of hiccups and didn't let India go through.</p><p>The Zimbabwean bowlers used the variations perfectly and didn't let any Indian batter be at ease. Sikandar Raza only compounded the pressure further and got a couple of scalps to his name. But that partnership between Avesh and Sundar surely got their heartbeats on again but Raza got the better of him in the end. Then came another turnaround as Luke Jongwe bowled a very poor over and conceded 12 runs in the 18th over. But those last two overs from Blessing Muzarabani&#160;and Tendai Chatara&#160;respectively, really choked down the defending champions.</p><p>Talk about a crazy turnaround! Zimbabwe was staring at a tough job, trying to defend a tiny score. But man, did they deliver or what? Chatara and Muzarabani came out swinging, knocking over India's big guns before they could even get going. Just like that, Zimbabwe flipped the script in those first few overs. Suddenly, a game that looked like a snoozefest turned into a real nail-biter. Luke Jongwe around the halfway mark, broke a brewing partnership by removing Jurel.</p><p>Shubman Gill was the sole exception who appeared at ease up top. The dismissal of the debutant Abhishek Sharma set off a chain reaction, leading to a rapid loss of three more wickets in short order.&#160;India was desperate for someone to step up and stop the bleeding. Entered a confident-looking&#160;debutant Dhruv Jurel. He failed to have any sort of&#160;impact.&#160;Meanwhile, Gill was holding down the fort like a champ, but even he couldn't last forever. Just when you thought he might save the day he got out for 31. As this game was a bag full of surprises, it was the stand between Washington Sundar and Avesh Khan that kind of brought back the hopes. But Khan couldn't dispatch that juicy full toss into the stands and was gone as well. However, India's last hope, Washington Sundar, held onto his nerves and counterpunched strongly like a lone warrior. He struck a few lusty blows that ascended the hopes back. But in the end, those dots towards the backend proved and cost India dearly.</p><p>THE REIGNING T20 WORLD CHAMPIONS ARE ROCKED, SHELL-SHOCKED! Zimbabwe&#160;script a history and the Harare Sports Club echoes with celebrations of&#160;the glory of the home side. Aren't you entertained? This game had all our nerves jangling and heartbeats pounding that could defeat any stethoscope.&#160;India's batting lineup crumbled early, with wickets falling in quick succession. The unpredictable bounce of the pitch seemed to trouble most batters. But credit&#160;to Zimbabwe, they bowled really well.&#160;</p>W<span>Overs</span>19.5<span>Score</span>102 - 10<p> Tendai Chatara to Washington Sundar, OUT! IN THE AIR AND GONE! Zimbabwe&#160;script a famous win, upstaging the reigning T20 champions! Tendai Chatara&#160;bends his back and directs a good bumper, aimed at the batter, Washington Sundar&#160;goes for the pull but he is tucked up for room and the ball gets big on him too. Gets a top edge that goes in the air and only as far as backward square leg. Blessing Muzarabani&#160;from short fine leg, runs to his right and keeps his eyes on the ball all the way through before diving full-length to take a brilliant catch. The ball stays in his grasp even as his elbow hits the turf. The crowd are jubilant as are Sikandar Raza&#160;and his men. Zimbabwe&#160;win by 13 runs to take a 1-0 lead in the series!</p>0<span>Overs</span>19.4<span>Score</span>102 - 9<p> Tendai Chatara to Washington Sundar, That should do it for Zimbabwe! Tendai Chatara&#160;now has to ensure that he does not overstep or bowl a wide here. Length delivery, going across the batter, on off, Washington Sundar&#160;stays deep in the crease but can only hit it along the ground to long off. The crowd erupts but Sikandar Raza&#160;signals to his players to calm down as the game is not over yet.</p>0<span>Overs</span>19.3<span>Score</span>102 - 9<p> Tendai Chatara to Washington Sundar, Johnathan Campbell, you beauty! Saves two for his side. Oh no, hang on. Washington Sundar&#160;did not run, so even better for Zimbabwe. A dot and it leaves India&#160;needing 14 runs now off the last 3 balls. Chatara offers width, on a length, outside off, Washington Sundar&#160;clears his front leg and smacks it hard to the left of deep cover where Johnathan Campbell&#160;springs to his left and dives to cut it off.</p>2<span>Overs</span>19.2<span>Score</span>102 - 9<p> Tendai Chatara to Washington Sundar,&#160;A good effort in the deep by Blessing Muzarabani&#160;to keep it down to two. Chatara is lucky to get away with it as this is short and too straight, around the hips, Washington Sundar&#160;gets inside the line but gets this one high on the bat. Gets enough bat on it to clear short fine leg.&#160;Muzarabani gives it a chase and slides to save a couple of runs for his side.</p>0<span>Overs</span>18.6<span>Score</span>100 - 9<p> Blessing Muzarabani to Khaleel Ahmed, Watchfully left alone by Khaleel.&#160;Muzarabani digs it in short but the line is outside off, Khaleel Ahmed&#160;sways away from the line of the ball and sees the ball nestle into the gloves of the keeper. Right then, we are going down to the final over with India&#160;needing 16 runs.</p>1<span>Overs</span>18.5<span>Score</span>100 - 9<p> Blessing Muzarabani to Washington Sundar, Sundar crosses over now, leaving Khaleel Ahmed&#160;to face one ball in this over.&#160;Muzarabani dishes it out on a hard length, outside off, Washington Sundar&#160;flays at the delivery and gets an outside edge that goes down to deep third for one. India need 16 runs off the last 7 balls.</p>1<span>Overs</span>17.6<span>Score</span>98 - 9<p> Luke Jongwe to Washington Sundar, And he succeeds in doing so. Fuller and at pace, on off, Washington Sundar&#160;extends his hands to drive it past cover but gets an inside edge that rolls to deep backward square leg for a single. 12 runs off the over, India&#160;are still alive in the game, needing 18 runs off the last 2 overs.</p>4<span>Overs</span>17.5<span>Score</span>97 - 9<p> Luke Jongwe to Washington Sundar, FOUR! Poor choice of delivery by Jongwe and it gets the treatment. With a short fine leg in place, Jongwe bowls the slower but the line is down leg, on a back of a length, Washington Sundar&#160;gets inside the line and pulls it up and over short fine leg for a boundary. Sundar will be looking to retain the strike now with a single off the last ball.</p>W<span>Overs</span>16.6<span>Score</span>86 - 9<p> Sikandar Raza to Mukesh Kumar, OUT! CLEANED HIM UP! Sikandar Raza&#160;strikes with the last ball of his spell! Zimbabwe&#160;on the cusp of a famous win. The crowd at the Harare Sports Club goes wild. Raza serves the off-break now, on a nagging length, on off, Mukesh Kumar&#160;is neither forward nor back and plays for the ball going straight on. The ball spins in after pitching and Mukesh ends up leaving a big gap between bat and pad. The ball sneaks past the inside edge to rattle into the off stump.</p>0<span>Overs</span>16.5<span>Score</span>86 - 8<p> Sikandar Raza to Mukesh Kumar, Is that out? Has Mukesh Kumar&#160;dragged his foot outside the crease? The keeper seems confident. This spins away from the right-hander, full and outside off, Mukesh Kumar&#160;gets on the front foot to keep it out but the ball goes the other way and beats the bat. The keeper is quick to whip the bails off and the third umpire is called into action. However, the replays show that at no point did Mukesh drag his foot out and it was grounded all the way through inside the crease.</p>0<span>Overs</span>16.2<span>Score</span>84 - 8<p> Sikandar Raza to Washington Sundar, Missed out! Sikandar Raza&#160;goes searching for the yorker but ends up serving a low full toss, on off, Washington Sundar&#160;misses out as he goes for the drive. The keeper is late in getting down, but luckily, his pads get in the way of the ball.</p>W<span>Overs</span>15.5<span>Score</span>84 - 8<p> Wellington Masakadza to Avesh Khan, OUT! STRAIGHT TO THE FIELDER! Not a wicket-taking delivery but Wellington Masakadza&#160;won't mind one bit. Avesh Khan&#160;is distraught. He could not have picked out the man in the deep any better. Low full toss, outside off, Avesh Khan&#160;stays low to make the connection and plays a cross-batted lofted stroke. Fails to get the elevation to clear the fence and hits it straight down the throat of long off where Sikandar Raza&#160;does the rest. Zimbabwe&#160;2 wickets away now from a famous win.</p>4<span>Overs</span>15.2<span>Score</span>80 - 7<p> Wellington Masakadza to Avesh Khan, FOUR! Misfield! A gift served to India in the form of a boundary. Fuller and on off and middle, Avesh Khan&#160;swats it along the ground to long on where Innocent Kaia&#160;runs in off the ropes and there is no pressure on him to release the throw quickly. Kaia lets it slip through his legs for a boundary.</p></div>
