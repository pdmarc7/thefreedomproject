					<div><p>Two political newcomers are challenging a Republican stalwart with a big home-field advantage as he seeks a promotion to the state&#8217;s upper chamber after serving four years in the Florida House.</p><p>Rep. Keith Truenow of Tavares has the backing of his party&#8217;s heavy hitters, including Gov. Ron DeSantis, as he runs for an open Florida Senate seat in Republican-heavy District 13, which includes all of Lake County and part of southwest Orange County.</p><p>Early on, it seemed Truenow might waltz to victory: He filed to run for the seat in 2022, just two weeks after securing his second term in the state House, quickly racking up tens of thousands of dollars in contributions and scoring an endorsement from outgoing Sen. Dennis Baxley, who had represented Lake County in the legislature for the better part of 20 years.</p><p>But in March 2023, a business owner from Horizon West with no political experience but lots of cash entered the race. That newcomer, Bowen Kou, has invested more than $1.2 million in his own campaign.</p><p>And over the past several months, the race has become among the most expensive in Central Florida, with Truenow and Kou spending several times what candidates in other local Senate districts have raised.</p><p>Truenow and Kou each have spent more than $800,000 from their campaign accounts and political committees, state records show. The Florida Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee also has invested mightily in this race, hitting households with a barrage of mail and TV ads slamming Kou.</p><p>A third candidate, Cheryl &#8220;C.J.&#8221; Blancett, lags far behind, having raised roughly $7,000 in in-kind and cash contributions, records show.</p><p>Only voters registered as Republicans will be able to cast votes in the primary, which will determine which candidate will face off against Democrat Stephanie Dukes in the November general election.</p><p>But the winner of the GOP primary likely will have an easy path to victory, as 44% of the district&#8217;s voters are registered as Republicans. Democrats comprise just 27% of the electorate.</p><p><strong>Where the candidates stand</strong></p><p>Truenow, 54, is a U.S. Air Force veteran and sod farmer who has represented much of Lake County in the Florida House since 2020. He declined an interview request from the Orlando Sentinel, writing in a text message his campaign was &#8220;in full swing.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I am focused on letting voters know about my record supporting good education, fiscal and infrastructure policy,&#8221; Truenow wrote, adding that, if elected, he&#8217;d like to work to improve workforce training opportunities.</p><p>His campaign website says he &#8220;has fought for lower taxes, smaller government and every right enumerated in the Constitution&#8221; during his time in the Florida House.</p><p>During the past session, he co-sponsored <a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2024/03/20/desantis-signs-bill-banning-homeless-from-sleeping-in-public-places/">a controversial bill designed to prevent homeless people from sleeping in public places.</a> The bill, HB 1365, drew criticism from Democrats and advocates who said it could criminalize people who have nowhere else to go. DeSantis signed the bill into law in March.</p><p>His most formidable challenger, Kou, is a 35-year-old business owner who was born in China and first came to the United States at 19 years old, when he enrolled at Michigan State University. He became a U.S. citizen in 2019 and moved with his family to Central Florida three years ago.</p><p>Kou owns nine stores and bakeries in seven states and said he employs more than 500 people. One of those locations, a bakery called Paris Baguette, is located in Horizon West.</p><p>Immigrating to America allowed Kou to pursue the life he desired and he wants his three children to benefit from the same opportunities he had.</p><p>&#8220;We want to focus on local issues and we want to focus on protecting the American dream for the next generation, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m running,&#8221; he said.</p><p>Kou&#8217;s priorities include reducing the cost of home insurance for Florida property owners, and he says the state needs to crack down on fraudulent claims.</p><p>He criticized Truenow&#8217;s support for a $2 billion taxpayer-financed plan designed to shore up the struggling property insurance industry that resulted in only modest savings for homeowners on their annual premiums. Lawmakers approved the plan during a special session in 2022.</p><p>He also said he wants the state to foster &#8220;smart development,&#8221; which he said means ensuring infrastructure, such as roads and schools, is in place before adding new homes.</p><p>During the past several weeks, Kou has become the target of attack ads by the Florida Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, a political organization aimed at helping elect GOP candidates to the state Senate. <a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2024/07/17/republican-candidate-in-central-florida-attacked-for-chinese-donors-his-attacker-the-gop/">He sued the organization, saying a mailer that hit mailboxes last month was false and defamatory</a>. That ad claimed Kou had taken campaign contributions from &#8220;Chinese citizens (from all over the country).&#8221;</p><p>The third candidate in the race, Blancett, faces long odds as her fundraising efforts trail far behind her opponents&#8217;. She said she hopes to put stricter limits on campaign contributions.</p><p>Blancett, 64, said she became interested in local politics, including the county&#8217;s Republican party, after moving to Lake County in 2020.</p><p>&#8220;I tried to become one with the community and it was at that time I uncovered so much corruption,&#8221; Blancett said.</p><p>Her campaign website describes her as a small business owner and retired investigator as well as a &#8220;motivator of souls, lover of life, seeker of truth and gladiator for the U.S. Constitution.&#8221;</p><p>Blancett, of Leesburg, was charged last year with<a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2024/07/05/orlando-area-state-senate-candidate-charged-with-48k-theft-from-hoa/"> stealing $47,722 from a homeowners association whose finances she managed.</a> She and is facing trial in September. If convicted of the second-degree felony, she faces up to 15 years in prison, according to Florida statutes.</p><p>She told the Sentinel earlier this month that she felt the charges were &#8220;politically motivated.&#8221;</p><p>anmartin@orlandosentinel.com</p>
